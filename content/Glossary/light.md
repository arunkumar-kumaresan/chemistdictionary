Light is electromagnetic radiation within the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be perceived by the human eye.

The primary properties of visible light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarization.

All types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates as waves. However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed in single locations the way particles are absorbed. 

The absorbed energy of the EM waves is called a photon and represents the quanta of light.

When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the energy of the wave instantly collapses.

### Sources of light

The main source of light on Earth is the Sun. Sunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches.

Atoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces "emission lines" in the spectrum of each [atom](https://chemistdictionary.com/atom-2/). 

Deceleration of a free charged particle, such as an electron, can produce visible radiation such as cyclotron radiation, synchrotron radiation, and bremsstrahlung radiation.

### Optics

The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.

Refraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. 

The refractive quality of lenses is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images.
