The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of a liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid.

At this point, the liquid changes into a vapour.

Boiling point is also referred as Saturation temperature.

The normal boiling point (**atmospheric boiling point** / **atmospheric pressure boiling point**) of a liquid is the case in which the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, at one atmosphere.

 A liquid in a partial vacuum has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure.

At any temperature a liquid partly vaporizes into the space.

This occurs when the pressure exerted by the vapour reaches a characteristic value called the vapour pressure of the liquid at that temperature. 

The standard boiling point has been defined by IUPAC since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of one bar.

The element with the lowest boiling point is [helium](https://chemistdictionary.com/helium/).

The boiling points of rhenium and tungsten exceed 5000 K at standard pressure(isobaric).

Hence, it is difficult to measure extreme temperatures precisely without bias, so both have been cited in the literature as having a higher boiling point.
