The unit cell is defined as the smallest repeating unit having the full symmetry of the crystal structure.

The geometry of the unit cell is defined as a parallelepiped, providing six lattice parameters taken as the lengths of the cell edges (_a_, _b_, _c_) and the angles between them (α, β, γ). 

The positions of particles inside the unit cell are described by the fractional coordinates (_x__i_, _y__i_, _z__i_) along the cell edges, measured from a reference point. 

The collection of symmetry operations of the unit cell is expressed formally as the space group of the crystal structure.

### Types of unit cell

A cubic crystal system is made up of three types of unit cells namely:

- Simple cubic: In this, the atoms can be found at the corners of the unit cell.
- Body-centred cubic: In bcc, all the atoms are present in the corners except one, which is found at the centre of the structure.
- Face-centred cubic: FCC contains corner atoms and the rest, in each of the face's centre.
