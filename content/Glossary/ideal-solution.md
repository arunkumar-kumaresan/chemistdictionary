An ideal solution is a homogeneous mixture of substances.

It has physical properties that are linearly related to the properties of the pure components.

An ideal solution or ideal mixture is a solution in which the gas phase exhibits thermodynamic properties analogous to those of a mixture of ideal gases.

The concept of an ideal solution is fundamental to chemical thermodynamics and its applications.

### Definition

The simplest definition is that an ideal solution is a solution for which each component obeys Raoult's law for all compositions.

The vapour pressures of the solutions are mathematically represented by a linear function of the molecular composition.
