Superfluidity is the characteristic property of a fluid with zero viscosity which therefore flows without any loss of kinetic energy.

When stirred, a superfluid forms vortices, which is a region in a fluid in which the flow revolves around an axis line, which may be straight or curved.

Superfluidity occurs in two isotopes of helium (helium-3 and helium-4) when they are liquefied by cooling to cryogenic temperatures.

Superfluid vacuum theory (SVT) is an approach in theoretical physics and [quantum mechanics](https://chemistdictionary.com/quantum-mechanics/) where the physical vacuum is viewed as a superfluid.

Superfluidity is coincidental with Bose-Einstein condensation, but neither phenomenon is directly related to the other. And not all Bose-Einstein condensates can be regarded as superfluids.

### History

Superfluidity was originally discovered in liquid [helium](https://chemistdictionary.com/helium/) by Pyotr Kapitsa and John F. Allen. It has since been described through phenomenology and microscopic theories.

Superfluidity in an ultracold fermionic gas was experimentally proven by Wolfgang Ketterle and his team who observed quantum vortices.
