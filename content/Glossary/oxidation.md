Oxidation is the loss of [electrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron/) or an increase in the oxidation state of an [atom](https://chemistdictionary.com/atom-2/), an [ion](https://chemistdictionary.com/ion/), or of certain atoms in a [molecule](https://chemistdictionary.com/molecule/).

The chemical species from which the electron is removed is said to have been oxidised.

Oxidation reactions are commonly associated with the formation of oxides from oxygen molecules and oxygen is not necessarily included in such reactions.

The word _oxidation_ originally implied reaction with oxygen to form an oxide, since dioxygen (O2) was historically the first recognized oxidizing agent. 

Substances that have the ability to _oxidize_ other substances are said to be _oxidative_ or oxidizing agents, oxidants, or oxidizers.

Oxidants are usually chemical substances with elements in high oxidation states, that can gain extra electrons by oxidizing another substance.
