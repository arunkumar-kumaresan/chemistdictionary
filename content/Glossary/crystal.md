A crystal or crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents (atoms, molecules, or ions) are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions.

Crystals are arranged in a definite pattern and whose surface regularity reflects its internal symmetry.

Crystals are often used in pseudoscientific practices such as crystal therapy along with gemstones.

### History

The word crystal derives from the ancient greek word κρύσταλλος (__krustallos__), meaning both ice and rock crystal.

### Crystal structure

Based on the unit cells, the crystals are classified into seven types. Here, the three planes are considered to be a,b,c and their corresponding angle formed, when two planes intersect is given as α, β and γ respectively.

### 1\. Simple cubic

 It is the **crystal system**, where the unit cell is in the shape of a cube.

Here, a=b=c and α=β= γ= 90°

### 2\. Tetragonal

Tetragonal crystal lattices result from stretching a cubic lattice along with one of its lattice vectors so that the cube becomes a rectangular prism with a square base.

Here, a = b ≠ c and α = β = γ = 90°

### 3\. Orthorhombic

Orthorhombic lattices result from stretching a cubic lattice along two of its orthogonal pairs by two different factors, resulting in a rectangular prism with a rectangular base.

Here, a ≠ b ≠ c and α = β = γ = 90°

### 4\. Rhombohedral

This crystal system consists of the 12 point groups such that at least one of their space groups has the hexagonal lattice as underlying lattice, and is the union of the hexagonal crystal system and the trigonal crystal system.

Here, a = b = c and α = β = γ ≠ 90°

### 5\. Monoclinic

 In the monoclinic system, the crystal is described by vectors of unequal lengths, as in the orthorhombic system. They form a rectangular prism with a parallelogram as its base.

Here, a ≠ b ≠ c and α = γ = 90° , β ≠ 90°

### 6\. Triclinic

It is described by vectors of unequal length, as in the orthorhombic system. The triclinic lattice is the least symmetric of the 14 three-dimensional Bravais lattices.

Here, a ≠ b ≠ c and α ≠ β ≠ γ ≠ 90°

### 7\. Hexagonal

The Bravais lattices in the hexagonal crystal family can also be described by rhombohedral axes. The hexagonal crystal system consists of the 7 point groups that have a single six-fold rotation axis.

Here, a = b ≠ c and α = β = 90°, γ ≠ 120°
