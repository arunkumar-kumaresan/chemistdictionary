Calorimeter is used in the process of measuring the [heat](https://chemistdictionary.com/heat/) of chemical reactions or physical changes as well as heat capacity.

A simple calorimeter just consists of a thermometer attached to a metal container full of water suspended above a [combustion](https://chemistdictionary.com/combustion/) chamber.

### History

In 1761 Joseph Black introduced the idea of latent heat which lead to the creation of the first ice-calorimeters.

In 1780, Antoine Lavoisier used the heat from the guinea pig's respiration to melt snow surrounding his apparatus, showing that respiratory gas exchange is the combustion, similar to a candle burning.

One of the first ice calorimeters was used in the winter of 1782 by Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace, which relied on the heat required to melt ice to water to measure the heat released from chemical reactions.

### Types of calorimeter

Calorimeter is classified into various types based on their applications.

### 1\. Bomb calorimeter

A bomb calorimeter is a type of constant-volume calorimeter used in measuring the heat of combustion of a particular reaction.

Bomb calorimeters have to withstand the large pressure within the calorimeter as the reaction is being measured.

### 2\. Adiabatic calorimeter

An adiabatic calorimeter is a calorimeter used to examine a runaway reaction.

A mathematical correction factor, known as the phi-factor, can be used to adjust the calorimetric result to account for these heat losses.

### 3\. Reaction calorimeter

A reaction calorimeter is a calorimeter in which a chemical reaction is initiated within a closed insulated container.

1. Heat flow calorimeter - The cooling or heating jacket controls either the temperature of the process or the temperature of the jacket. Heat is measured by monitoring the temperature difference between heat transfer fluid and the process fluid. 
2. Heat balance calorimeter - The cooling or heating jacket controls the temperature of the process. Heat is measured by monitoring the heat gained or lost by the heat transfer fluid.
3. Power compensation - Power compensation uses a heater placed within the vessel to maintain a constant temperature.
4. Constant flux calorimeter - Constant flux calorimetry (COFLUX) is derived from heat balance calorimetry and uses specialized control mechanisms to maintain a constant heat flow across the vessel wall.
