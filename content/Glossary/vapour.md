Vapour is a substance in the [gas](https://chemistdictionary.com/gas/) phase at a [temperature](https://chemistdictionary.com/temperature/) lower than its critical temperature, which means that the vapour can be condensed to a [liquid](https://chemistdictionary.com/liquid/) by increasing the [pressure](https://chemistdictionary.com/pressure/).

A vapour may co-exist with a liquid or a solid. When this is true, the two phases will be in equilibrium, and the gas-partial pressure will be equal to that of a liquid or solid.

The equilibrium vapour pressure of a liquid or solid is not affected by the amount of contact with the liquid or solid interface.

Vapour is responsible for the familiar processes of cloud formation and [condensation](https://chemistdictionary.com/condensation/). And it is mostly employed in [distillation](https://chemistdictionary.com/distillation/) processes.

The constituent molecules of a vapour possess vibrational, rotational, and translational motion. These motions are considered in the kinetic theory of gases.

Since it is in the gas phase, the amount of vapour present is quantified by the partial pressure of the gas and obey the barometric formula in a gravitational field.
