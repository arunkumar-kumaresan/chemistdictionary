Subatomic particles are smaller than [atoms](https://chemistdictionary.com/atom-2/) and they can be composite particles, such as the neutron and proton or other elementary particles.

The term "_subatomic_ particle" is largely used to distinguish a large number of [baryons](https://chemistdictionary.com/baryon/) and mesons from particles that are now thought to be truly elementary.

The concept of a subatomic particle was refined when experiments showed that [light](https://chemistdictionary.com/light/) could behave like a stream of particles as well as exhibiting wave-like properties. 

Any subatomic particle, like any particle in the three-dimensional space that obeys [quantum mechanics](https://chemistdictionary.com/quantum-mechanics/) laws, can be either a boson (with integer spin) or a fermion (with odd half-integer spin).

All observable subatomic particles have their electric charge an integer multiple of the elementary charge. 

The collision energy between particles becomes available for the creation of subatomic particles such as mesons and hyperons.

More than 200 subatomic particles have been detected and most of them highly unstable, existing for less than a millionth of a second.

As a result of collisions produced in cosmic-ray reactions or particle accelerator experiments and understanding the nature of matter and energy and of the origin of the universe.
