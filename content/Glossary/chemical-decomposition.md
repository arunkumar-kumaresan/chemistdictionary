Chemical decomposition is the process or effect of simplifying a single chemical entity into two or more fragments. It is also known as chemical breakdown.

Due to this, often an undesired chemical reaction takes place.

Usually, decomposition reactions require energy input.

### Classification of decomposition reactions

- Thermal decomposition - chemical decomposition caused by heat.
- Electrolytic decomposition - Breaking of components when electricity is passed.
- Photolytic decomposition - Breaking of photons.
