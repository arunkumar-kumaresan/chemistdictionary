P- block consists of a set of metallic elements in the [periodic table](https://chemistdictionary.com/periodic-table/) located between the transition metals to their left and the [metalloids](https://chemistdictionary.com/metalloid/) to their right.

Alternate names for the elements in this group are B-subgroup metals, other [metals](https://chemistdictionary.com/metal/), and post-transition metals.

Post-transition metals are soft, have poor mechanical strength, and have [melting points](https://chemistdictionary.com/melting-point/) lower than those of the transition metals.

Usually included in this category are the [group](https://chemistdictionary.com/group/) 13–15 metals in periods 4–6 which includes, gallium, indium, thallium, tin, lead and bismuth.

The p-block metals are typical, that is not strongly reducing and that, as such, they are base metals requiring oxidizing acids to dissolve them.

Being close to the metal-nonmetal border, their crystalline structures tend to show covalent or directional bonding effects.

### Nomenclature

The origin of the term post-transition metal is unclear. An early usage is recorded by Deming, in 1940, in his well-known book Fundamental Chemistry.

He referred to the ensuing elements in periods 4 to 6 of the periodic table, in view of their underlying d10 [electronic configuration](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron-configuration/) as post-transition metals.
