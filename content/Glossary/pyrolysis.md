Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere. It involves a change of chemical composition. 

Pyrolysis is most commonly used in the treatment of organic materials. It is one of the processes involved in charring wood.

In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves a solid residue enriched in [carbon](https://chemistdictionary.com/carbon/).

Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert biomass into synthetic gas and biochar, waste plastics back into usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances.

### History

The word is coined from the Greek which means pyro fire and lysis separating.

Pyrolysis has been used for turning wood into charcoal since ancient times. Pyrolysis was also instrumental in the discovery of many important chemical substances.

### Types of pyrolysis

Complete pyrolysis of organic matter usually leaves a solid residue that consists mostly of elemental carbon and the process is said to be carbonisation.

More specific cases of pyrolysis include:

- Dry distillation, as in the original production of sulfuric acid from sulfates
- Destructive distillation, as in the manufacture of charcoal, coke and activated carbon.
- Thermal depolymerization, that breaks down plastics and other polymers into monomers and oligomers.
- Hydrous pyrolysis, in the presence of superheated water or steam, also used in oil refining.
- Ceramisation involving the formation of polymer derived ceramics from preceramic polymers under an inert atmosphere.
- Catagenesis, the natural conversion of buried organic matter to fossil fuels.
- Flash vacuum pyrolysis, used in organic synthesis.
