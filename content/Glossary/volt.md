One volt is defined as the difference in electric potential between two points of a conducting wire when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points.

The volt is the derived unit for electric potential, electric potential difference (voltage), and electromotive force.

It is represented by the symbol V and the unit is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta, who is credited as the inventor of electric battery.

It can also be expressed as amperes times ohms, webers per second, watts per ampere, or joules per coulomb, which is also equivalent to electronvolts per elementary charge.

### History

In 1861, Latimer Clark and Sir Charles Bright coined the name "volt" for the unit of resistance.

Later, in 1881, the International Electrical Congress, now the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), approved the volt as the unit for electromotive force.
