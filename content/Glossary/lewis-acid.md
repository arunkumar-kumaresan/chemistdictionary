Lewis acid is a chemical species that contains an empty orbital which is capable of accepting an electron pair from a Lewis base.

The Lewis acid and [Lewis base](https://chemistdictionary.com/lewis-base/) form a Lewis adduct which is a product of direct addition of two or more distinct [molecules](https://chemistdictionary.com/molecule/), resulting in a single reaction product.

The term Lewis acid also known as an electron-pair acceptor is restricted to trigonal planar species with an empty p orbital.

The simple Lewis acid examples include:

BF3 + F− → BF4−

In this adduct, all four fluoride centres are equivalent.

I2 + I− → I3−

The variability of the colours of iodine solutions reflects the variable abilities of the solvent to form adducts with the Lewis acid I2.

A modern definition of a Lewis acid is an atomic or molecular species with a localized empty atomic or molecular orbital of low energy.

Lewis acidity emphasizes the thermodynamic aspect of Lewis adduct formation.

Lewis acid in action is in the Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction due to its electrophilic property.

### History

The concept originated with Gilbert N. Lewis who studied chemical bonding in 1923. The Brønsted–Lowry acid-base theory was published in the same year. The two theories are distinct but complementary.
