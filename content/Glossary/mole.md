Mole is the SI unit of measurement for the amount of substance which may be atoms, molecules, ions, or [electrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron/).

The amount of substance in a given sample of matter is defined as the number of discrete atomic-scale particles in it divided by the Avogadro constant ( 6.02214076×1023 mol−1).

Gram-atom is the formerly used term for a mole of [atoms](https://chemistdictionary.com/atom-2/).

The concept of the mole helps to put quantitative information about what happens in a chemical equation on a macroscopic level. 

When dealing with reactions that take place in solutions, the related concept of molarity is useful.

Molarity (_M_) is defined as the number of moles of a solute in a litre of solution.

### History

The name _mole_ is an 1897 translation of the German unit _Mol_, coined by the chemist Wilhelm Ostwald in 1894 from the German word _Molekül_ (molecule). However, the related concept of equivalent mass had been in use at least a century earlier.

The mole was made the seventh SI base unit in 1971 by the 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM).
