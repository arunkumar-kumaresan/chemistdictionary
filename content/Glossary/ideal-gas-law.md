Ideal gas law is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas.

It is also called the general gas equation or perfect gas law.

An ideal gas may not change temperature, but most gases like air are not ideal and follow the Joule–Thomson effect.

### History

It was first stated by Émile Clapeyron in 1834 as a combination of the empirical Boyle's law, Charles's law, Avogadro's law, and Gay-Lussac's law.

### Statement

According to the ideal gas law, when a gas is compressed into a smaller volume, the number and velocity of molecular collisions increase, raising the gas's temperature and pressure.

The ideal gas law is often written in an empirical form as,

**_PV = nRT_**

Where,

P, V, T is the pressure, volume, temperature respectively.

n is the amount of substance.

R is the ideal gas constant.
