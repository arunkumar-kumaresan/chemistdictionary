Hadron is a subatomic composite particle made of two or more quarks held together by a strong electromagnetic force.

A **quark** is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter.

Almost all "free" hadrons and anti-hadrons are believed to be unstable and eventually decay into other particles.

All observed subatomic particles are hadrons except for the gauge bosons of the fundamental interactions and the leptons. 

Hadron physics is studied by colliding protons or nuclei of heavy elements such as lead or gold, and detecting the debris in the produced particle showers. 

### Etymology

The word Hadron is derived from Greek origin _hadrós_, meaning stout or thick.

### Classification of hadrons

Hadrons are characterized into two families:

### 1\. Baryons

Baryons are hadrons containing an odd number of valence quarks (at least 3).

Most well-known baryons such as the proton and neutron have three valence quarks.

Each type of baryon has a corresponding antiparticle (anti-baryon) in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks.

### 3\. Mesons

Mesons are hadrons containing an even number of valence quarks (at least 2).

Most well-known mesons are composed of a quark and anti-quark pair, but possible tetraquarks (4 quarks) and hexaquarks (6 quarks, comprising either a dibaryon or three quark-antiquark pairs).
