A Lewis base is any species that has a filled orbital containing an electron pair which is not involved in bonding but may form a dative bond.

The [Lewis acid](https://chemistdictionary.com/lewis-acid/) and Lewis base form a Lewis adduct which is a product of direct addition of two or more distinct molecules, resulting in a single reaction product.

The Lewis basicity emphasize the thermodynamic aspect of Lewis adduct formation.

A Lewis base is an atomic or molecular species where the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is highly localized.

Typical Lewis bases are conventional amines such as ammonia and alkylamines. Other common Lewis bases include pyridine and its derivatives. 

Lewis bases are multidentate, that is they can form several bonds to the Lewis acid. These multidentate Lewis bases are called chelating agents.

### History

The terminology refers to the contributions of Gilbert N. Lewis. The Brønsted–Lowry acid-base theory was published in the same year. The two theories are distinct but complementary.

A Lewis base is also a Brønsted–Lowry base.
