Diffusion is the net movement of anything (i.e. atom, ions, molecules) from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.

Diffusion is driven by a gradient in [concentration](https://chemistdictionary.com/concentration/).

[Heat](https://chemistdictionary.com/heat/) conduction in fluids involves thermal energy transported, or diffused, from higher to lower temperature.

Diffusion is the gradual movement or dispersion of concentration within a body, due to a concentration gradient, with no net movement of matter.

### History

The word diffusion derives from the Latin word, _diffundere_, which means to spread out. 

### Basic models of diffusion

Each model of diffusion expresses the diffusion flux through concentrations, densities and their derivatives

### 1\. Fick's law of diffusion

In this law, the diffusion flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient.

It is otherwise said to be as Fick's first law.

Fick's law describes the diffusion of an admixture in a medium. 

The concentration of this admixture should be small and the gradient of this concentration should be also small.

### 2\. Onsager's equations for multicomponent diffusion and thermodiffusion

In 1931, Lars Onsager included the multicomponent transport processes in the general context of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

### 3\. Non-diagonal diffusion must be nonlinear

If the matrix of diffusion coefficients is diagonal, then this system of equations is just a collection of decoupled Fick's equations for various components. Assume that diffusion is non-diagonal.

Non-diagonal equations of multicomponent diffusion must be non-linear.

### 4\. Fluctuation-dissipation theorem

Fluctuation-dissipation theorem based on the Langevin equation is developed to extend the Einstein model to the ballistic time scale.

### 5\. Diffusion in porous media

Care must be taken to properly account for the porosity (Φ) of the porous medium in both the flux terms and the accumulation terms.

For example, as the porosity goes to zero, the molar flux in the porous medium goes to zero for a given concentration gradient.
