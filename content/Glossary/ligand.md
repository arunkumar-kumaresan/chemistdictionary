Ligand is an [ion](https://chemistdictionary.com/ion/) or [molecule](https://chemistdictionary.com/molecule/) that binds to a central metal atom to form a coordination complex. The nature of metal-ligand bonding can range from covalent to ionic. The bonding with the metal involves the donation of one or more of the ligand's electron pairs. 

Ligand selection is a critical consideration in many practical areas, including bioinorganic and medicinal chemistry, homogeneous catalysis, and environmental chemistry.

Ligands are classified in many ways, including:

- Charge
- Size
- Identity of coordinating atoms
- The number of electrons donated to the metal (denticity)

The metal-ligand bond can be stabilised by a formal donation of electron density back to the ligand in a process known as back-bonding.

### Ligand Motifs

Ligands exhibit motifs(patterns) based on coordination.

1. Trans-spanning ligands are bidentate ligands that can span coordination positions on opposite sides of a coordination complex.
2. Ambidentate ligands can attach to the central atom in two places. 
3. Bridging ligand links two or more metal centres.
4. Binucleating ligands bind two metal ions.
5. Spectator ligand is a tightly coordinating poly-dentate ligand that does not participate in chemical reactions but removes active sites on a metal. 
6. Bulky ligands are used to control the steric properties of a metal centre.
7. Chiral ligand is employed as an optically pure group. 
8. Hemilabile ligands contain at least two electronically different coordinating groups and form complexes where one of these is easily displaced from the metal centre while the other remains firmly bound.
9. Non-innocent ligands bond with metals in such a manner that the distribution of electron density between the metal centre and ligand is unclear.
