A chemical compound is any substance composed of identical molecules consisting of atoms of two or more chemical elements. In which, more than one element is held together by [chemical bonds](https://chemistdictionary.com/bond/).

A compound can be converted to a different chemical composition by interaction with a second chemical compound via a [chemical reaction](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-reaction/).

### Types of chemical compound

There are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together.

1. **Molecules** \-  Electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Here, the atoms are bonded by covalent bonds.
2. **Ionic compounds** -  Composed of ions held together by electrostatic forces termed ionic bonding.
3. **Intermetallic compounds** -  Has solid phases containing two or more metallic elements, with optionally one or more non-metallic elements, whose crystal structure differs from that of the other constituents.
4. **Complex compounds** - Consists of a central atom or ion, which is usually metallic and is called the coordination centre, and a surrounding array of bound molecules or ions, that are in turn known as ligands or complexing agents.
