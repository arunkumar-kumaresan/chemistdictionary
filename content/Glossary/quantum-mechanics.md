Quantum mechanics is a part of quantum field theory, is a fundamental theory in physics. It describes the physical properties of nature on an atomic scale.

The other names for Quantum mechanics are QM, quantum physics, quantum theory, the wave mechanical model and matrix mechanics.

Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system.

Quantum mechanics incorporates four classes of phenomena for which classical physics cannot account:

- Quantization of certain physical properties
- Quantum entanglement
- Principle of uncertainty
- Wave-particle duality

The rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental. They assert that the state space of a system is a Hilbert space which is crucially the space that has an inner product.

The observables of the system are Hermitian operators acting on vectors in that space, although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators. 

Quantum mechanics explains the aspects of nature at small (atomic and subatomic) scales, for which classical mechanics is insufficient.

### History

The word _quantum_ derives from the Latin, meaning "how great" or "how much". In quantum mechanics, it refers to a discrete unit.

The gradual recognition that radiation has particle-like properties and that matter has wave-like properties provided the impetus for the development of quantum mechanics. 

This is influenced by Newton, but most physicists of the 18th century believed that light consisted of particles, which they called corpuscles.
