Distillation is the process of separating the components from a liquid mixture by using selective boiling and [condensation](https://chemistdictionary.com/condensation/).

In other words, it is used to separate liquids from nonvolatile solids.

The device used in distillation, sometimes referred to as a _still_, consists of

- Re-boiler or _pot_ in which the source material is heated.
- A condenser in which the heated vapour is cooled back to the liquid state.
- A receiver in which the concentrated or purified liquid, called the distillate, is collected.

### History

The distillation process appears to have been utilized by the earliest experimentalists. 

Aristotle (384–322 BC) mentioned that pure water is made by the evaporation of seawater.

Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) described a primitive method of condensation in which the oil obtained by heating rosin is collected on wool placed in the upper part of an apparatus known as a still.

### Classification of distillation processes

The distillation processes are classified into various types based on the model and their applications.

### 1\. Idealized distillation model

Idealized models of distillation are essentially governed by Raoult's law and Dalton's law and assume that vapour–liquid equilibria are attained.

The idealized model is accurate in the case of chemically similar liquids, such as benzene and toluene.

### 2\. Laboratory scale distillation

Laboratory scale distillations are almost exclusively run as batch distillations.

To increase efficiency, air condensers, virgreux columns, packed columns and spinning band distillation systems are used.

### 3\. Azeotropic distillation

Interactions between the components of the solution create properties unique to the solution, as most processes entail non-ideal mixtures, where Raoult's law does not hold.

Such interactions can result in a constant-boiling azeotrope which behaves as if it were a pure compound.

If the azeotrope is not considered sufficiently pure for use, there exist some techniques to break the azeotrope to give a pure distillate. This set of techniques are known as azeotropic distillation.

### 4\. Industrial distillation

Large scale industrial distillation applications include both batch and continuous fractional.

Industrial distillation is typically performed in large, vertical cylindrical columns known as distillation towers or distillation columns.

### Applications

Distillation is an effective and traditional method of desalination.

Cryogenic distillation leads to the separation of air into its components.

Vacuum distillation is applicable when the material to be distilled is immiscible.
