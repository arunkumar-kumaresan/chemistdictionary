Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odourless, and nearly colourless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms. 

It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula is H2O, in which atoms are held together by a [covalent bond](https://chemistdictionary.com/covalent-bond/).

Water is the only common substance to exist as a solid, liquid, and gas in normal terrestrial conditions.

In a water molecule, the [hydrogen](https://chemistdictionary.com/hydrogen/) atoms form a 104.5° angle with the oxygen atom. The hydrogen atoms are close to two corners of a tetrahedron centred on the oxygen. 

Water is a good polar solvent, that dissolves many salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as sugars and simple [alcohols](https://chemistdictionary.com/alcohol/) such as ethanol. 

Water also dissolves many gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, the latter giving the fizz of carbonated beverages, sparkling wines and beers. 

Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighbouring molecules. Hydrogen bonds are about ten times as strong as the Van der Waals force.
