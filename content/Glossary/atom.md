An atom is the smallest constituent unit of an ordinary matter, which constitutes a chemical component. Atoms are the building blocks of matter.

Atoms are made up of nucleus, [electrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron/) and protons. Every state of matter is composed either of neutral or ionized atoms.

If a number of protons = number of electrons, then Atom is said to be neutral.

The electrons and protons bound together in an atom by an electromagnetic force.
