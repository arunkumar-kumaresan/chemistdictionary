Hydrogenation is a chemical reaction between molecular hydrogen (H2) and another compound or element, usually in the presence of a [catalyst](https://chemistdictionary.com/catalyst/).

The process is commonly employed to reduce or saturate organic compounds.

Hydrogenation typically constitutes the addition of pairs of hydrogen atoms to a molecule, often an alkene. 

The addition of hydrogen is used in the production of edible fats from liquid oils. 

### History

The earliest hydrogenation is that of platinum-catalyzed addition of hydrogen to oxygen in the Döbereiner's lamp.

The French chemist Paul Sabatier is considered as the Father of hydrogenation, who discovered this process in 1897.

### Categories of hydrogenation processes

The hydrogenation process is classified into two types based on the catalysts used.

### 1\. Homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation

The development of well defined homogeneous catalysts using transition metal complexes leads to this process.

Asymmetric hydrogenation was demonstrated in the synthesis of L-DOPA in the 1990s.

### Metal-free hydrogenation

Hydrogenation requires a metal catalyst.

This proceeds from some hydrogen donors without catalysts, illustrative hydrogen donors being diimide and aluminium isopropoxide.
