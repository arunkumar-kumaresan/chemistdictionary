Reducing agent is an element or [compound](https://chemistdictionary.com/compound/) that loses an electron to an electron recipient ([oxidizing agent](https://chemistdictionary.com/oxidizing-agents/)) in a redox chemical reaction.

A reductant or reducer is thus oxidized when it loses electrons in the redox reaction and have extra electrons.

Common reducing agents include metals potassium, calcium, barium, sodium and magnesium, and also compounds that contain the H− ion.

Strong reducing agents easily lose (or donate) electrons. An atom with a relatively large [atomic radius](https://chemistdictionary.com/atomic-radius/) tends to be a better reductant.

Good reducing agents tend to consist of atoms with low [electronegativity](https://chemistdictionary.com/electronegativity/), the ability of an atom or molecule to attract bonding electrons.

Reducing agents and oxidizing agents are the ones responsible for [corrosion](https://chemistdictionary.com/corrosion/), which is the degradation of metals as a result of electrochemical activity.

The reducing agent is stronger when it has a more negative reduction potential and weaker when it has a more positive reduction potential. 

[Hydrogen](https://chemistdictionary.com/hydrogen/) gas is a reducing agent when it reacts with [non-metals](https://chemistdictionary.com/non-metals/) and an oxidizing agent when it reacts with [metals](https://chemistdictionary.com/metal/).
