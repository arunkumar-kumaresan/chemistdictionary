The neutron is a subatomic particle, with no electric charge.

Its mass is slightly greater than the [proton](https://chemistdictionary.com/proton/).

The rest mass of neutron is 1.67493 × 10−27 kg.

Neutrons and protons commonly called nucleons and are bound together.

The sum of the atomic number and the number of neutrons gives the mass of the nucleus.

Free neutrons, while not directly ionising atoms, cause ionising radiation.

### Discovery

The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist James Chadwick. 

Later, It was found that various elements, when bombarded by neutrons, undergo fission nuclear reaction.
