A solution is a special type of homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances in relative amounts that can be varied continuously up to the limit of solubility.

In such a mixture, a solute is a substance dissolved in another substance, known as a solvent. 

The mixing process of a solution happens at a scale where the effects of chemical polarity are involved, resulting in interactions that are specific to solvation. 

Concentration is a measure of the amount of solute in a given amount of solution or solvent.

### Characteristics

The particles of solute in a solution cannot be seen by the naked eye. A solution does not allow beams of light to scatter.

A solution is stable. The solute from a solution cannot be separated by filtration (or mechanically).

### Types of solutions

The solutions are classified based on the phase of the mixture after solubility.

### 1\. Homogeneous solution

Homogeneous means that the components of the mixture form a single phase, although the phase of the solute and solvent may initially be different.

### 2\. Heterogeneous solution

Heterogeneous means that the components of the mixture are of different phase. In this, the proportions vary throughout the sample.
