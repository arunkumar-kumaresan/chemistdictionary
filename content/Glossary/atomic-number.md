Atomic number is represented by the symbol **Z**.

It is the number of a chemical element in the periodic system. The elements of the [periodic table](https://chemistdictionary.com/periodic-table/) are listed in order of increasing [atomic number](https://chemistdictionary.com/atomic-number/).

In a neutral atom, the atomic number is equal to the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus.
