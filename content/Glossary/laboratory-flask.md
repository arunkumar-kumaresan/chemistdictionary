Laboratory flask is a vessel or container that fall into the category of laboratory equipment known as glassware. Flasks come in many shapes and a wide range of sizes.

But all flasks have a commonly distinguishing aspect in their shapes with a wider vessel body and a narrower tubular section at the top called necks which have an opening at the top.

At the opening at top of the neck of some glass flasks, there are outer (or female) tapered (conical) ground glass joints.

Laboratory flask sizes are specified by the volume they can hold, typically in metric units such as millilitres (mL) or litres (L). 

### Types of flasks

Flasks are characterized by the function and use it can holds. Few of them are:

Dewar flask \- A double-walled flask having a near-vacuum between the two walls. 

Distillation flasks - Intended to contain mixtures, which are subject to distillation. They are sometimes spherical, test tube-shaped, or pear-shaped, also known as a Kjeldahl Flask, due to its use with Kjeldahl bulbs.

Reagent flasks \- Usually have a flat-bottomed flask. These flasks cannot withstand too much pressure or temperature differences, due to the stresses which arise in a flat bottom.

Schlenk flask - A spherical flask with a ground-glass opening and a hose outlet with a vacuum stopcock.

Cassia flasks - Analysis of essential oils and aldehyde determination.

Powder flasks - For drying of powdered substances, pear-shaped, with the socket.
