Inorganic chemistry deals with the synthesis and behaviour of inorganic and organometallic compounds.

Many inorganic compounds are ionic compounds, consisting of cations and anions joined by ionic bonds.

After a period of quiescence in the early part of the 20th century, inorganic chemistry has again become an exciting area of research.

The first important man-made inorganic compound was ammonium nitrate for soil fertilization through the Haber process.

### Classification of inorganic chemistry

- Descriptive inorganic chemistry \- This focuses on the classification of compounds based on their properties. Partly this classification determines by grouping compounds based on their structural similarities.
- Mechanistic inorganic chemistry - This focuses on reaction mechanisms
- Inorganic chemistry in theory - This study involves qualitative and quantitative studies.
- Inorganic compounds in thermodynamics \- This approach is highly traditional and empirical
