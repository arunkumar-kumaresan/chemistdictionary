An electrolyte is a substance that produces an electrically conducting solution when dissolved in a polar solvent, such as water.

The dissolved electrolyte separates into cations and anions, which disperse uniformly through the solvent. Electrically, such a solution is neutral.

The most familiar electrolytes are acids, bases, and salts, which ionize when dissolved in such solvents as water or alcohol. 

### History

The word _electrolyte_ derives from Ancient Greek ήλεκτρο- (_ēlectro_\-), prefix related to electricity, and λυτός (_lytos_), which means able to be untied or loosened.

Arrhenius proposed that, even in the absence of an electric current, solutions of salts contained ions. He thus proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions.

### Solid elctrolytes

Gel electrolytes \- closely resemble liquid electrolytes.

Dry polymer electrolytes - Differ from liquid and gel electrolytes in the sense that salt is dissolved directly into the solid medium. Usually, it is a relatively high dielectric constant polymer.

Solid ceramic electrolytes - Ions migrate through the ceramic phase by means of vacancies or interstitials within the lattice. There are also glassy-ceramic electrolytes.

Organic ionic plastic crystals - Type of salts exhibiting mesophases (a state of matter intermediate between liquid and solid), in which mobile ions are orientationally or rotationally disordered while their centers are located at the ordered sites in the crystal structure.

Strong electrolyte - a solution/solute that completely, or almost completely, ionizes or dissociates in a solution. These ions are good conductors of electric current in the solution.
