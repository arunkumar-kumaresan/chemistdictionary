Radioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive. 

It is also considered as nuclear decay, radioactivity, radioactive disintegration or nuclear disintegration and this is a stochastic process at the level of single atoms.

There are three most common types of decay:

1. Alpha decay - It occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha particle.
2. Beta decay - When the nucleus emits an electron/positron and a neutrino/antineutrino in a process that changes a neutron to a proton
3. Gamma decay - A radioactive nucleus first decays by the emission of an α or β particle, then it can decay to a lower energy state by emitting a gamma-ray photon.

The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide (or parent radioisotope), and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide. 

There are few radioactive decay processes that do not result in a nuclear transmutation or results in products that vary by two or more fragments of the original nucleus.

In contrast, decay products from a nucleus with spin may be distributed non-isotropically with respect to that spin direction.

Radioactive decay results in a reduction of summed rest mass, once the released energy (the _disintegration energy_) has escaped in some way. 

### History

Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by the French scientist Henri Becquerel while working with phosphorescent materials. These radiations were given the name "Becquerel Rays".

The International System of Units (SI) unit of radioactive activity is the becquerel (Bq), named in honour of the scientist Henri Becquerel.
