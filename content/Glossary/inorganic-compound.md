Inorganic compounds are substances in which two or more chemical elements (other than [carbon](https://chemistdictionary.com/carbon/)) are combined in definite proportions.

The study of inorganic compounds is known as [inorganic chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/inorganic-chemistry/).

Some simple compounds that contain carbon are often considered inorganic. Examples include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbonates, carbides and cyanides.

Inorganic compounds are most often classified in terms of the elements or groups of elements that they contain. 

Inorganic compounds comprise most of the Earth's crust.

### History

Werner has been called the father of modern inorganic chemistry.

He was recognised and won the Nobel prize in 1913.

### Properties

Inorganic compounds have high melting points.

These compounds are poor conductors in the solid-state.
