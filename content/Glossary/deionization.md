Deionization is the process of ion-exchange. It is a [chemical process](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-process/) that uses specially manufactured ion-exchange resins, which exchange hydrogen and hydroxide ions for dissolved minerals and then recombine to form water. 

It does not significantly remove uncharged organic molecules, viruses or bacteria, except by incidental trapping in the resin.

### Types of deionization

#### 1\. Co-current deionization

It refers to the original downflow process where both input water and regeneration chemicals enter at the top of an ion-exchange column and exit at the bottom. 

#### 2\. Counter-current deionization

It comes in two forms, each requiring engineered internals:

1. Upflow columns where input water enters from the bottom and regenerants enter from the top of the ion exchange column.
2. Upflow regeneration where water enters from the top and regenerants enter from the bottom.

#### 3\. Mixed bed ionization

It is a 50/50 mixture of cation and anion resin combined in a single ion-exchange column.
