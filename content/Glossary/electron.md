Electron is the lightest stable subatomic particle.

It carries a negative charge of 1.602176634 × 10−19 coulomb.

An electron is considered nearly massless in comparison with a proton or a neutron.

Hence, the electron mass is not included in calculating the mass number of an atom.

Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nuclei of atoms by the attraction between opposite electric charges.

Within any given atom, electrons move about the nucleus in an orderly arrangement of orbitals.

### History

The electron was discovered in 1897 by the English physicist J.J. Thomson during investigations of cathode rays. His discovery of electrons, which he initially called corpuscles.

In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states.

In 1919, the American chemist Irving Langmuir elaborated on the Lewis' static model of the atom and suggested that all electrons were distributed in successive concentric (nearly) spherical shells, all of equal thickness.

In the Standard Model of particle physics, electrons belong to the group of subatomic particles called leptons, which are believed to be fundamental or elementary particles.
