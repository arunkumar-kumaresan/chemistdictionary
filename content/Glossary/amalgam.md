Amalgam is an [alloy](https://chemistdictionary.com/alloy/) of mercury and one or more other metals.

It may be a liquid, a soft paste or a solid, depending upon the proportion of mercury.

The reaction of the amalgam with water produces a solution of sodium hydroxide and regenerates the mercury for reuse.

These alloys are formed through metallic bonding, with the electrostatic attractive force of the conduction electrons working to bind all the positively charged metal ions together into a [crystal](https://chemistdictionary.com/crystal/) lattice structure.

### Essential Amalgams

- Zinc Amalgam - Used in organic synthesis. It is the reducing agent in the Jones reductor, used in analytical chemistry.
- Potassium Amalgam - These amalgams are very sensitive to air and water, but can be worked with under dry nitrogen.
- Sodium Amalgam - Used as an important reducing agent in organic and inorganic chemistry.
- Aluminium Amalgam \- This amalgam is used as a reagent to reduce compounds, such as the reduction of imines to amines. 
- Tin Amalgam \- Tin amalgam was used in the middle of the 19th century as a reflective mirror coating.
- Dental Amalgam - Dentistry has used alloys of mercury with metals such as silver, copper, indium, tin and zinc. Amalgam is an "excellent and versatile restorative material" and is used in dentistry for a number of reasons. 
- Gold Amalgam - Used in mining.
