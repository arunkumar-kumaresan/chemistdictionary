An oxidising agent is a substance that has the ability to oxidize other substances. In other words, it has the ability to accept their [electrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron/).

An oxidizing agent is a chemical species that undergoes a [chemical reaction](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-reaction/), and mainly in redox reactions, in which it gains one or more electrons.

An oxidizing agent is a chemical species that transfers electronegative atoms, usually oxygen, to a substrate. These agents are otherwise called as oxidizers or oxidants.

In the above context, the oxidising agent can be called an oxygenation reagent or oxygen-atom transfer (OAT) agent.

Common oxidizing agents are oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and the [halogens](https://chemistdictionary.com/halogens/).
