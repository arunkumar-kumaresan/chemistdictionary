Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number, and consequently in nucleon number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of [protons](https://chemistdictionary.com/proton/).

Isotopes of Hydrogen

An isotope is specified by the name of the particular element followed by a hyphen and the mass number.

### History

The name isotope is from the Greek _isos_, meaning same and _topos_, signifying “place” of hydrogen. The existence of isotopes was first suggested in 1913 by the radio-chemist  Frederick Soddy.

The studies include radioactive decay chains that indicated about 40 different species referred to as radio-elements. The first evidence for multiple isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element was found by J J Thomson in 1912.

### Classification of isotopes

The lexicon of isotopes includes three other categories:

- Isotones - Isotopes of different elements with the same number of neutrons.
- Isobars - Isotopes of different elements with the same mass number.
- Isomers - Isotopes with the same number of protons and neutrons but differ in energy.
