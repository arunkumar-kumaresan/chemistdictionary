Alloy is a metallic substance composed of two or more elements. Simply, it is a mixture of metals. It contains two or more chemical components, of which one is mandatory to be a metal.

### Classification of Alloys

Alloys are classified depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy.

1. **Substitutional Alloys** - Alloys formed when the two metallic components have similar atomic radii and chemical bonding characteristics. (Eg. Gold and Silver).
2. **Interstitial Alloys** - Alloys formed when an atom of sufficiently small radius sits in a hole in a metal lattice. (Eg. Iron and [Carbon](https://chemistdictionary.com/carbon/)).
3. **Homogeneous Alloys** - Alloys that consist of a single-phase and mixtures consist of several phases. (Eg. Steel, Amalgam).
4. **Heterogeneous Alloys** - Alloys that consists of two or more phases. (Eg. Pearlite, Cementite).
5. **Intermetallic** - Alloys formed from electropositive and electronegative metals which chemically bond to form compounds with a specific composition and crystalline structure. (Eg. Roman Yellow Brass).

### Uses of Alloys

- To improve the properties of metals.
- It is corrosion-resistant.
- Enhance tensile strength.
- Increase durability.
