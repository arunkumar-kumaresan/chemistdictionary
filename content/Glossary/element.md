 An **element** is a pure substance which cannot be broken down by chemical means, consisting of atoms which have identical numbers of protons in their atomic nuclei.

In total, 118 elements have been identified.

The first 94 occur naturally on Earth, and the remaining 24 are synthetic elements produced in nuclear reactions. 

The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that discovered native minerals like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold.

The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium, both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass along with tiny traces of the next two elements, lithium and beryllium.

Modern understanding of elements is attributed to Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist who published the first recognizable periodic table in 1869.

Elements can combine with one another to form a wide variety of more complex substances called compounds.
