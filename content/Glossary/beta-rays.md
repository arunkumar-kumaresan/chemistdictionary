Beta rays are a high-energy, high-speed electron or positron emitted by the [radioactive decay](https://chemistdictionary.com/radioactive-decay/) of an atomic nucleus during the process of beta decay. 

Beta particles with an energy of 0.5 MeV have a range of about one metre in air and the distance is dependent on the particle energy.

These are also referred to as beta particles or beta radiation with medium ionising power and medium penetrating power.

The ionising or excitation effects of beta particles on the matter are the fundamental processes by which radiometric detection instruments detect and measure beta radiation. 

### Types of beta decay

There are two forms of beta decay, β− decay and β+ decay, which produce electrons and positrons respectively.

### β− decay

An unstable atomic nucleus with an excess of neutrons may undergo β− decay, where a neutron is converted into a proton, an electron, and an electron antineutrino.

This process is known as electron emission and occurs among the neutron-rich fission byproducts produced in nuclear reactors.

### β+ decay

Beta-plus decay can only happen inside nuclei when the absolute value of the binding energy of the daughter nucleus is greater than that of the parent nucleus.

This process is also known as positron emission. In this, where a proton is converted into a neutron, a positron, and an electron neutrino.
