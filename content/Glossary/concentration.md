Concentration is the abundance of a constituent divided by the total volume of a mixture.

A concentration can be any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently solutes and solvents in solutions.

### Concentration types

There are four quantities that describe concentration.

1. **Mass concentration** - The mass concentration of a component in a mixture can be called the density of a component in a mixture. It is denoted as _ρ_ (Rho).
2. **Molar concentration** -  Measuring concentration in terms of the amount of substance per unit volume of solution. It’s SI unit is mol/L.
3. **Number concentration** \-  It is the degree of concentration of countable objects.
4. **Volume concentration** -  It is one form of way of expressing the composition of a mixture with a dimensionless quantity.
