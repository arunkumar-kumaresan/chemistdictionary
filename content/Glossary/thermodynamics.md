Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation, and properties of matter.

Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, especially [physical chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/physical-chemistry/), chemical engineering and mechanical engineering.

The initial application of thermodynamics to mechanical heat engines was quickly extended to the study of [chemical compounds](https://chemistdictionary.com/compound/) and [chemical](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-reaction/) [reactions](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-reaction/).

A thermodynamic process may be defined as the energetic evolution of a thermodynamic system proceeding from an initial state to a final state.

### Etymology

The word thermodynamics is derived from the Greek root therme, meaning “heat”, and dynamic_,_ meaning “power”, which was coined by American biophysicist Donald Haynie.

Pierre Perrot claims that the term thermodynamics was coined by James Joule in 1858 to designate the science of relations between heat and power.

### Laws of thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is principally based on a set of four laws which are universally valid.

### Zeroth law

The zeroth law of thermodynamics states: If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

The zeroth law was not initially recognised as a separate law of thermodynamics, as its basis in thermodynamical equilibrium was implied in the other laws. 

### First law

It states that in a process without transfer of matter, the change in internal energy, of a thermodynamic system is equal to the energy gained as heat, done by the system on its surroundings.

This law is an expression of the principle of conservation of energy.

### Second law

The second law of thermodynamics states that the heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder location to a hotter location.

### Third law

The third law of thermodynamics states: As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.

Entropy is a measure of how much this process has progressed.
