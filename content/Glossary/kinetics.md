Kinetics in chemistry is concerned with understanding the rates of chemical reactions. It is also known as Chemistry kinectics or reaction kinetics, is a branch of physical chemistry.

Chemical kinetics includes experimental conditions, that influence the speed of a [chemical reaction](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-reaction/) and yield information about the reaction's mechanism and transition states.

It is to be contrasted with thermodynamics, which deals with the direction in which a process occurs but in itself tells nothing about its rate.

Chemical kinetics relates to many aspects of cosmology, geology, biology, engineering, and even psychology.

One reason for the importance of kinetics is that it provides evidence for the mechanisms of chemical processes. 

Chemical kinetics provides information on residence time and heat transfer in a chemical reactor in chemical engineering.

### History

Peter Waage and Cato Guldberg pioneered the development of chemical kinetics by formulating the law of mass action in 1864.

The law states that the speed of a chemical reaction is proportional to the quantity of the reacting substances.
