Anions are atoms or radicals (groups of atoms) carrying a negative electric charge. In other terms, those are the atoms that have gained electrons. It is otherwise said to be a negative ion.

Anions are termed so because they are attracted towards the [anode](https://chemistdictionary.com/anode/) (the positive electrode).

### Formation of anions

Anions are formed when a [metal](https://chemistdictionary.com/metal/) loses [electrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron/), and a nonmetal gains those electrons. All anions tend to accept a [proton](https://chemistdictionary.com/proton/) (H+), thus they are categorised as a [base](https://chemistdictionary.com/base/).
