Gay-Lussac primarily investigated the relationship between volume and temperature and published it in 1802.

But his work did cover some comparison between pressure and temperature.

Amontons was only able to work with air as a gas, where Gay-Lussac was able to experiment with multiple types of common gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen.

### Statement

Gay-Lussac's law states that the pressure of a given mass of gas varies directly with the absolute temperature of the gas when the volume is kept constant.

It is also referred as Amontons's law.

Mathematically, it can be written as,

![{\displaystyle {\frac {P}{T}}=k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4cd53f424daf3ee56d9e82976692c5ddb6e47448)

where,

P is the pressure of the gas

T is the absolute temperature of the gas.
