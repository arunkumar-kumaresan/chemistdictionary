A transition metal is any element whose atom has a partially filled d sub-shell, or which can give rise to [cations](https://chemistdictionary.com/cation/) with an incomplete d sub-shell.

Many scientists describe a "transition metal" as an element in the d-block of the [periodic table](https://chemistdictionary.com/periodic-table/), which includes groups 3 to 12 on the periodic table.

Most of them in the group are hard, strong, and lustrous, have high [melting](https://chemistdictionary.com/melting-point/) and [boiling points](https://chemistdictionary.com/boiling-point/) and are good conductors of heat and electricity.

The Madelung rule predicts that the typical electronic structure of transition metal atoms can be written as \[inert gas\]_ns_2(_n_ − 1)_d__m_ .

The inner d orbital is predicted to be filled after the valence-shell's _s_ orbital is filled. This rule is however only to approximate.

### Properties

There are a number of properties shared by the transition elements that are not found in other elements, which results from the partially filled d shell. These include:

- The formation of compounds whose colour is due to _d_–_d_ electronic transitions.
- The formation of compounds in many oxidation states, due to the relatively low energy gap between different possible oxidation states
- The formation of many paramagnetic compounds due to the presence of unpaired _d_ electrons.
- The transition metals and their compounds are known for their homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic activity.
