A chain reaction is a sequence of reactions where a reactive product or byproduct causes additional reactions to take place. 

Chain reactions are very rapid and also highly sensitive to reaction conditions.

The substances that sustain the reaction are easily affected by substances other than the reactants themselves.

Nuclear chain reactions are a series of nuclear fissions (splitting of atomic nuclei), each initiated by a neutron produced in preceding fission.

Numerous chain reactions can be represented by a mathematical model based on Markov chains.

### History

In 1913, the German chemist Max Bodenstein first put forth the idea of chemical chain reactions. 

A quantitative chain chemical reaction theory was created later on by Soviet physicist Nikolay Semyonov in 1934. 

### Steps involved in chain chemical reactions

A chain chemical reaction is subdivided into three types:

1. Initiation - Formation of active particles or chain carriers, often free radicals, in either a thermal or a photochemical step.
2. Propagation - The intermediate reacts with the original reactants, producing stable products and another intermediate.
3. Termination - Elementary step in which the active particle loses its activity.
