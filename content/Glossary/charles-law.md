Charle's law is also known as the law of volume.

This law describes how a gas expands as the temperature increases; conversely, a decrease in temperature will lead to a decrease in volume. 

### Statement

When the pressure on a sample of a dry gas is held constant, the Kelvin temperature and the volume will be in direct proportion.

The relationship can be given in equation form as,

V= kT

where,

V= volume of the gas

T= temperature in Kelvin scale

k= non zero constant.

### History

The law was named after scientist Jacques Charles, who formulated the original law in his unpublished work from the 1780s.
