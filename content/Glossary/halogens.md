Halogens are a group in the [periodic table](http://periodi) consisting of five chemically related elements.

The group consists of fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At).

Halogens are highly reactive, and as such can be harmful or lethal to biological organisms in sufficient quantities.

Fluorine is one of the most reactive elements, it is the only element more electronegative than oxygen, it attacks otherwise-inert materials such as glass, and it forms compounds with the usually inert noble gases. 

When halogens react with metals, they produce a wide range of salts.

The halogens show trends in chemical bond energy moving from top to bottom of the periodic table column with fluorine deviating slightly.

### History

In 1811, the German chemist Johann Schweigger proposed that the name "halogen" means "salt-producing".

The fluorine mineral fluorspar was known as early as 1529. Early chemists realized that fluorine [compounds](https://chemistdictionary.com/compound/) contain an undiscovered element, but were unable to isolate it. 

Bromine was discovered in the 1820s by Antoine Jérôme Balard.

Iodine was discovered by Bernard Courtois, who was using seaweed ash as part of a process for saltpeter manufacture.
