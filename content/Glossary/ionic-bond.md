An ionic bond is a type of linkage formed from the electrostatic attraction.

It is formed between oppositely charged ions in a chemical compound.

An ionic bond is also referred to as Electro-valent bond.

This type of bonding results in compounds known as ionic, or electro-valent compounds.

Ionic bonding can result from a redox reaction when atoms of an element (usually metal), whose ionisation energy is low.

It is important to recognise a clean ionic bonding in which one atom or molecule completely transfers an electron to another.

Ionic compounds in the solid-state form lattice structures.

### Formation of ionic bonds

An ionic bond is formed when the valence electrons (outermost) of one atom are transferred permanently to another atom.

 Typically, these bonds form when the difference in the electronegativities of the two atoms is great.
