Catalyst is any substance that increases the rate of a reaction without itself being consumed.

Catalyzed reactions form the basis of many industrial chemical processes. 

During the reaction between the chemical intermediates and the reactants, the catalyst is regenerated.

Catalytic action is a chemical reaction between the catalyst and a reactant.

These actions form chemical intermediates that are able to react more readily with each other or with another reactant, to form the desired end product.

Typical of these reactions are acid-base reactions, oxidation-reduction reactions, formation of coordination complexes, and formation of free radicals.

Most solid catalysts are metals or non-metals.

This includes oxides, sulfides, and halides of metallic elements and of the semi-metallic elements boron, aluminium, and silicon.

### Catalytic process and their catalysts

Few commonly used catalyst are:

- Iron \- Ammonia synthesis.
- Nitrogen(II) oxide, Platinum - Sulfuric acid manufacturing.
- Zeolites - Cracking of petroleum.
- Nickel, Platinum, or Palladium - Hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
