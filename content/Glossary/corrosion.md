**Corrosion** is a natural process that converts a refined metal into a more chemically stable form such as oxide, hydroxide, or sulfide. 

It is the gradual destruction of materials by chemical or electrochemical reaction with their environment. 

Corrosion can also occur in materials other than metals, such as ceramics or polymers.

Corrosion degrades the useful properties of materials and structures including strength, appearance and permeability to liquids and gases.

### Preventive methods

Some materials resist corrosion naturally; others can be treated to protect them.

### 1\. Coating

Coating is a covering that is applied to the surface of an object, usually referred to as the substrate.

Many industrial coating processes involve the application of a thin film of functional material to a substrate, such as paper, fabric, film, foil, or sheet stock.

### 2\. Galvanization

 It is the process of applying a protective zinc coating to steel or iron, to prevent rusting. 

### 3\. Anodizing

Anodic films are most commonly applied to protect aluminium alloys, titanium, zinc, magnesium, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, and tantalum.
