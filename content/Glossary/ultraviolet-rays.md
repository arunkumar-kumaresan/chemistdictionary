Ultraviolet (UV) is a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength from a corresponding frequency, approximately from 10 to 400 nm, shorter than that of visible light.

UV radiation is present in sunlight and constitutes about 10% of the total electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun. 

The lower wavelength limit of human vision is conventionally taken as 400 nm, so ultraviolet rays are invisible to humans, although some people can perceive light at slightly shorter wavelengths.

### History

Ultraviolet means beyond violet from Latin ultra, beyond violet being the colour of the highest frequencies of visible light. Ultraviolet has a higher frequency than the violet light.

UV radiation was discovered in 1801 when the German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter observed that invisible rays just beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum.

The discovery of the ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths below 200 nm, named "vacuum ultraviolet" because it is strongly absorbed by the oxygen in the air, was made in 1893 by the German physicist Victor Schumann.

### Sub-types of UV radiation

The electromagnetic spectrum of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), defined most broadly as 10–400 nano-meters, can be subdivided into a number of ranges recommended by the ISO standard.
