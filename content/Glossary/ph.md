In chemistry, pH is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an [aqueous solution](https://chemistdictionary.com/aqueous-solution/), denoting the power of [hydrogen](https://chemistdictionary.com/hydrogen/).

The pH scale is logarithmic and inversely indicates the [concentration](https://chemistdictionary.com/concentration/) of hydrogen ions in the solution.

The formula used to calculate pH approximates the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. 

At 25 °C, solutions with a pH,

- Less than 7 - acidic
- Greater than 7 - basic
- The neutral value of the pH depends on the temperature. It's approximately equals 7.

The pH scale is traceable to a set of standard solutions whose pH is established by international agreement.

Indicators may be used to measure pH, by making use of the fact that their colour changes with pH as a visual comparison.

pH standard values are determined using a concentration cell with transference, by measuring the potential difference between a hydrogen and a standard electrode.

### History

The concept of pH was first introduced by the Danish chemist Søren Peder Lauritz Sørensen in 1909 and revised to the modern pH in 1924.

The first electronic method for measuring pH was invented by Arnold Orville Beckman, a professor at California Institute of Technology in 1934.
