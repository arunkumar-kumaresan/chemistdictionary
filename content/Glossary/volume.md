Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance ([solid](https://chemistdictionary.com/solid/), [liquid](https://chemistdictionary.com/liquid/), [gas](https://chemistdictionary.com/gas/), or [plasma](https://chemistdictionary.com/plasma/)) or shape occupies or contains.

Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container.

Other traditional units of volume are also in use, including the cubic inch, the cubic foot, the cubic yard, the cubic mile, the teaspoon, the tablespoon, the fluid ounce, etc.

In [thermodynamics](https://chemistdictionary.com/thermodynamics/), the volume of a system is an important extensive parameter for describing its thermodynamic state. 

The specific volume is an intensive property, is the system's volume per unit of mass. Volume is a function of state and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as [pressure](https://chemistdictionary.com/pressure/) and [temperature](https://chemistdictionary.com/temperature/).

The volume of a solid (whether regularly or irregularly shaped) can be determined by fluid displacement.

Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas.
