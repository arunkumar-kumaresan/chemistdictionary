The numeric value of the Avogadro constant expressed in a reciprocal [mole](https://chemistdictionary.com/mole/), a dimensionless number, is called the Avogadro number.

Avogadro number =  6.02214076 × 1023

The units may be depending on the nature of elements.

It is mostly denoted by _N_ or _N_0.

The value of the Avogadro constant was chosen so that the mass of one mole of a chemical compound, in grams, is numerically equal to the average mass of one molecule of the compound, in daltons.

### History

The Avogadro constant is named after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro in 1811, who first proposed that the volume of a gas is proportional to the number of atoms or molecules regardless of the nature of the [gas](https://chemistdictionary.com/gas/).

The name _Avogadro's number_ was coined in 1909 by the physicist Jean Perrin, who defined it as the number of molecules in exactly 32 grams of oxygen.
