The thermal conductivity of a material is a measure of its ability to conduct heat. This is the reciprocal of thermal resistivity.

The effect of temperature on thermal conductivity is different for [metals](https://chemistdictionary.com/metal/) and [nonmetals](https://chemistdictionary.com/non-metals/). In metals, heat conductivity is primarily due to free electrons. 

Gases generally have low thermal conductivity, and pure metals have high thermal conductivity.

In the International System of Units (SI), thermal conductivity is measured in watts per meter-kelvin. But some paperwork report as watts per centimetre-kelvin.

The dimension of thermal conductivity is M1L1T−3Θ−1, expressed in terms of the dimensions mass (M), length (L), time (T), and temperature (Θ).

When a material undergoes a phase change, that is from solid state to liquid state, the thermal conductivity may change abruptly.

In metals, thermal conductivity approximately tracks electrical conductivity according to the Wiedemann–Franz law, transfer not only electric current but also heat energy. 

### Measuring thermal conductivity

There are several ways to measure thermal conductivity, each method is suitable for a limited range of materials. Broadly speaking, there are two categories of measurement techniques: 

- Steady-state technique: Infers the thermal conductivity from measurements of material once a steady-state temperature profile has been reached.
- Transient technique: Operates on the instantaneous state of a system during the approach to steady-state.
