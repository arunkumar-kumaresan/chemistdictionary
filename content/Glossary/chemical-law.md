Chemical laws are those laws of nature relevant to [chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemistry/).

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the law of conservation of mass, which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary chemical reaction.  

### Major laws of chemistry

The basic laws that are required to gain basic knowledge are proposed and experimented by various chemists.

### 1\. Law of conservation of energy

The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy in an isolated system neither be created nor destroyed. It remains conserved over time.

This law was first proposed and tested by Émilie du Châtelet.

### 2\. Law of conservation of mass

Matter can neither be created nor destroyed, though it can be rearranged. 

Historically, mass conservation was demonstrated in chemical reactions independently by Mikhail Lomonosov and later rediscovered by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century.

### 3\. Boyle's law

This law states that the absolute pressure exerted by a given mass of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies if the temperature and amount of gas remain unchanged within a closed system.

### 4\. Avogadro's law

Equal volumes of gases under identical temperature and pressure will contain equal numbers of particles.

### 5\. Law of thermodynamics

- First law - The total energy of the universe is constant and can neither be created nor destroyed. This law is also known as Conservation of Energy.
- Second law - Entropy increases over time. In other words, heat cannot flow, on its own, from an area of cold to an area of hot.

### 6\. Dalton's law

The pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the component gases.

### 7\. Faraday's law

This states that the amount of material produced at an electrode during an electrochemical reaction is directly proportional to the total conducted charge or the average current multiplied by the total time.
