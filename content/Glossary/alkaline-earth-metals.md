Group-2 of the periodic table comprises Alkaline Earth metals.

This series consists of six elements.

This group is otherwise called as Beryllium family.

They are called alkaline earth metals since their oxides form in the earth and are water-soluble.

### Discovery

1. [Beryllium](https://chemistdictionary.com/beryllium/) - In 1828, Friedrich Wöhler and Antoine Bussy independently isolated this new element, beryllium, by the same method, which involved a reaction of beryllium chloride with metallic potassium; this reaction was not able to produce large ingots of beryllium.
2. Magnesium \- Magnesium was first produced by Humphry Davy in England in 1808 using electrolysis of a mixture of magnesia and mercuric oxide.
3. Calcium - Calcium itself, was not isolated until 1808, when Humphry Davy used electrolysis on a mixture of lime and mercuric oxide, after hearing that Jöns Jakob Berzelius had prepared a calcium amalgam from the electrolysis of lime in mercury.
4. Strontium - Strontium was eventually isolated in 1808 by Humphry Davy by electrolysis of a mixture of strontium chloride and mercuric oxide.
5. Barium -Barite, a mineral containing barium, was first recognized as containing a new element in 1774 by Carl Scheele, although he was able to isolate only barium oxide.
6. Radium - All the discovered alkaline earth metals occur in nature, although radium occurs only through the decay chain of uranium and thorium and not as a primordial element. On 21 December 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie discovered that.

### Applications

1. Beryllium is used mostly for military applications.

2. Magnesium is also often alloyed with aluminium or zinc to form materials with more desirable properties than any pure metal.

3. Calcium has a role in the making of cheese, mortars, and cement.

4. Strontium carbonate is often used in the manufacturing of red fireworks, and pure strontium is used in the study of neurotransmitter release in neurons.

5. Radium used to be used often in luminous paints, although this use was stopped after workers got sick.
