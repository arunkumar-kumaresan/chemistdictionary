A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve, but get suspended throughout the bulk of the [solvent](https://chemistdictionary.com/solvent/).

The particles may be visible to the naked eye, usually must be larger than one micrometre, and will eventually settle.

A suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid particles in a gas is called an aerosol. In the atmosphere, the suspended particles are called particulates.

Suspensions are classified on the basis of the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, where the former is essentially solid while the latter may either be a solid, a liquid, or a gas.

Suspensions are unstable from a thermodynamic point of view but can be kinetically stable over a longer period of time.

In modern chemical process industries, high-shear mixing technology has been used to create many novel suspensions.

Common examples of suspensions include:

- Mud or muddy water: where soil, clay, or silt particles are suspended in water.
- Flour suspended in water.
- Kimchi suspended one vinegar.
- Water-Alcohol suspension.
