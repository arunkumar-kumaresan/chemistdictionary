A salt bridge is a laboratory device used to connect the oxidation and reduction half-cells of a [galvanic cell](https://chemistdictionary.com/galvanic-cell/) (voltaic cell), a type of electrochemical cell.

It maintains the electrical neutrality within the internal circuit, preventing the cell from rapidly running its reaction to equilibrium. 

If no salt bridge is present, then the solution in the one-half cell would accumulate negative charge in the other half cell would accumulate a positive charge. Thus quickly preventing further reaction.

If no salt bridge is present, then the reactions would be prevented and the production of electricity would also be affected.

### Types of salt bridge

Salt bridges usually come in two types: glass tube and filter paper.

### 1\. Glass tube bridge

It consists of a U-shaped glass tube filled with a relatively inert electrolyte, usually potassium chloride or sodium chloride.

The conductivity of a glass tube bridge depends mostly on the [concentration](https://chemistdictionary.com/concentration/) of the electrolyte solution. 

Beyond saturation electrolyte content and narrow tube diameter may both lower conductivity.

### 2\. Filter paper bridge

This type of salt bridge consists of a filter paper, soaked with a relatively inert electrolyte.

The conductivity of this salt bridge depends on a number of factors: the concentration of the electrolyte solution, the texture of the filter paper and the absorbing ability of the filter paper.
