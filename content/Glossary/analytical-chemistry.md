Analytical chemistry is the study and use of instruments, methods to separate, identify, and quantify matter.

It consists of classical, wet chemical methods and modern, instrumental methods.

It is also focused on improvements in experimental design, chemometrics, and the creation of new measurement tools.

In practice, separation, identification or quantification may constitute the entire analysis or be combined with another method. 

Qualitative analysis identifies analytes, while quantitative analysis determines the numerical amount or [concentration](https://chemistdictionary.com/concentration/).

### History

Analytical chemistry has been important since the early days of [chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemistry/), providing methods for determining which elements and chemicals are present in the object.

During this period significant contributions to analytical chemistry include the development of systematic elemental analysis by Justus von Liebig.

Most of the major developments in analytical chemistry take place after 1900. During this period instrumental analysis becomes progressively dominant in the field.

The first instrumental analysis was flame emissive spectrometry developed by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff.

### Classical methods used in Analytical chemistry

Although modern analytical chemistry is dominated by sophisticated instrumentation, the roots of analytical chemistry and some of the principles used in modern instruments are from traditional techniques.

### 1\. Qualitative analysis

Qualitative analyses do not measure quantity.

- Chemical test \- Procedure designed to identify, quantify, or characterise a chemical compound or chemical group.
- Flame test \- To detect the presence of certain elements, primarily metal ions, based on each element's characteristic emission spectrum. The color of flames in general also depends on temperature.

### 2\. Quantitative analysis

Quantitative analysis is the measurement of the quantities of particular chemical constituents present in a substance.

- Gravimetric analysis -  This involves determining the amount of material present by weighing the sample before and/or after some transformation.
- Volumetric analysis - Titration involves the addition of a reactant to a solution being analyzed until some equivalence point is reached. Often the amount of material in the solution being analyzed may be determined.
