Heat is the flow of [energy](https://chemistdictionary.com/energy/) from a warm object to a cooler object.

As a technical term in thermodynamics, it refers to energy transfer in between systems by mechanisms other than thermodynamic work or transfer of matter.

Heat transfer is a process involving more than one system, not a property of any one system.

Heat energy is the result of the movement of tiny particles called [atoms](https://chemistdictionary.com/atom-2/), molecules or ions in all states of matter.

### Process of heat transfer

A substance get heated up depending on the properties of that substance.

In solid materials, heat is transferred through conduction, for liquid and [gas](https://chemistdictionary.com/gas/) states, it is transferred by convection.

### 1\. Conduction

Conduction is the heat flux through solid materials. This process transfers heat through molecular collision.

### 2\. Convection

Convection is the heat flux through liquid and gases. In convection, the liquid or gas is heated and then travels away from the source.

### 3\. Radiation

Radiation is the heat flux through electromagnetic waves. In radiation, the heat is transferred through space or any material medium, which could be any sort of electromagnetic waves.
