Temperature is a physical property of matter that quantitatively expresses hot and cold. It is the manifestation of thermal energy.

Temperature is represented by letter T and it's SI unit is Kelvin(K), which is named in the honour of physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin.

Temperature is measured with a thermometer which is calibrated in various temperature scales that historically have used various reference points and thermometric substances.

The most common scales are the Celsius scale (formerly called _centigrade_, denoted °C), the Fahrenheit scale (°F), and the Kelvin scale (denoted K).

The lowest theoretical temperature is absolute zero, at which no more thermal energy can be extracted from a body.

When a body is not in a steady-state, then the notion of temperature becomes even less safe than for a body in a steady-state not in thermodynamic equilibrium. 

In thermal equilibrium, when two systems in thermal contact are at the same temperature no heat transfers between them.

But when a difference in temperature is encountered the heat transfers from the warmer system to the colder system.
