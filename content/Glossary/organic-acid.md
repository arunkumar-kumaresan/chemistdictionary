An organic acid is an organic compound with acidic properties.

The most common organic acids are the carboxylic acids, whose acidity is associated with the carboxyl group –COOH.

In biological systems, organic compounds containing these groups are generally referred to as organic acids.

Organic acids are weak acids and do not dissociate completely in water, whereas the strong mineral acids do.

These organic acids are much less reactive with [metals](https://chemistdictionary.com/metal/) than are strong mineral acids.

Few examples of organic acids include:

- Lactic Acid: It is white in solid-state and it is miscible with water.
- Acetic Acid: Weak, colourless liquid organic compound.
- Formic Acid: This is a colourless liquid having a pungent, penetrating odour
- Citric Acid: Weak organic acid occurs naturally in citrus fruits. 
- Oxalic Acid: It is a white crystalline solid that forms a colourless solution in water. 
- Uric Acid:  A heterocyclic compound of [carbon](https://chemistdictionary.com/carbon/), nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen.
- Malic Acid: It is a dicarboxylic acid that is made by all living organisms, contributes to the sour taste of fruits.
- Tartaric Acid: A white, crystalline organic acid that occurs naturally in many fruits, most notably in grapes.

### Applications

The conjugate bases of organic acids such as citrate and lactate are often used in biologically compatible buffer solutions.

Citric and oxalic acids are used as rust removal. 

Organic acids are used in food preservation because of their effects on bacteria.
