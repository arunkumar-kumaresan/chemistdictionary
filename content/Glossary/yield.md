Yield is a measure of the quantity of [moles](https://chemistdictionary.com/mole/) of a product formed in relation to the reactant consumed, obtained in a [chemical reaction](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-reaction/), usually expressed as a percentage.

Yield is one of the primary factors that scientists must consider in organic and inorganic [chemical synthesis](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-synthesis/) processes.

In chemical reaction engineering, "yield", is the much-desired product that was formed in ratio to the undesired product.

Percentage yield can be expressed in equation as:

Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield)\*100

The percentage yield is a comparison between the actual yield, which is the weight of the intended product of a chemical reaction in a laboratory setting.

The theoretical yield is the measurement of the pure intended isolated product, based on the chemical equation of a flawless chemical reaction.
