Resonance is a way of describing bonding in certain molecules or ions by the combination of several contributing structures (or _forms_).

It is known as resonance structures or canonical structures into a resonance hybrid (or _hybrid structure_) in valence bond theory.

It has particular value for describing delocalized electrons within certain molecules or polyatomic ions where the bonding cannot be expressed by one single Lewis structure.

The resonance hybrid represents the actual molecule as the "average" of the contributing structures, with bond lengths and partial charges taking on intermediate values.

The resonance proposal also helped explain the number of isomers of benzene derivatives. 

### History

The concept first appeared in 1899 in Johannes Thiele's "Partial Valence Hypothesis" to explain the unusual stability of benzene.

The mechanism of resonance was introduced into [quantum mechanics](https://chemistdictionary.com/quantum-mechanics/) by Werner Heisenberg in 1926 in a discussion of the quantum states of the [helium](https://chemistdictionary.com/helium/) atom.
