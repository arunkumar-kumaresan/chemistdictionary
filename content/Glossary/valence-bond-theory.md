Valence bond (VB) theory is one of the two basic theories that were developed to use the methods of [quantum mechanics](https://chemistdictionary.com/quantum-mechanics/) to explain [chemical bonding](https://chemistdictionary.com/bond/). 

It focuses on how the atomic orbitals of the dissociated atoms combine to give individual chemical bonds when a [molecule](https://chemistdictionary.com/molecule/) is formed.

The basis of VB theory is the Lewis concept of the electron-pair bond. A single Lewis structure cannot be written, so several valence-bond structures are used. 

Valence bond theory views bonds as weakly coupled orbitals and is typically easier to employ in ground-state molecules.

The overlapping atomic orbitals can differ. The two types of overlapping orbitals are:

- Sigma bonds occur when the orbitals of two shared electrons overlap head-to-head. 
- Pi bonds occur when two orbitals overlap when they are parallel.

An important aspect of the valence bond theory is the condition of maximum overlap, which leads to the formation of the strongest possible bonds.
