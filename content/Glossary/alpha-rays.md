Alpha rays consist of two protons and two neutrons bound together into a particle identical to a helium-4 nucleus.

They are generally produced in the process of alpha decay, but may also be produced in other ways. Alpha particles are named after the first letter in the Greek alphabet, α. 

It is also known as alpha particles or radiation and The symbol for the alpha particle is α or α2+ or He2+,4 2He2+, indicating a helium ion.

Due to the mechanism of their production in standard alpha radioactive decay, alpha particles generally have a kinetic energy of about 5 MeV.

They are a highly ionizing form of particle radiation and have low penetration depth. They can be stopped by a few centimetres of air, or by the skin.

When an atom emits an alpha particle in alpha decay, the atom's mass number decreases by four due to the loss of the four nucleons in the alpha particle.

Alpha particles are commonly emitted by all of the larger radioactive nuclei such as uranium, thorium, actinium, and radium, as well as the transuranic elements.
