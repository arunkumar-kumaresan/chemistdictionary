The term exothermic process describes a process or reaction that releases energy from the system to its surroundings.

The released energy may be in the form of heat, light, electricity or sound.

In an adiabatic system (a system that does not exchange heat with the surroundings), an exothermic process results in an increase in temperature of the system.

In exothermic chemical reactions,

- The heat that is released by the reaction takes the form of electromagnetic energy.
- The light released is absorbed by other molecules in solution, which give rise to molecular rotations.

### History

The Greek prefix (exō) which means "outwards" and (thermikόs) which means "thermal".

The term exothermic was first coined by Marcellin Berthelot.
