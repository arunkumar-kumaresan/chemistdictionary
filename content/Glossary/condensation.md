Condensation refers to the water cycle.

Condensation is the change of the physical state of matter from the gas phase into the liquid phase.

It is the reverse process of vaporization.

### Process

Condensation is initiated by the formation of atomic or molecular clusters of that species within its gaseous volume.

It may be raindrop or snowflake formation within a cloud or at the contact between such a gaseous phase and a liquid or solid surface.

Heat is released when vapour condenses. Unless this heat is removed, the surface temperature will increase until it is equal to that of the surrounding vapour.

If air were free of tiny particles, called aerosols, condensation would only occur when the air was extremely supersaturated with water vapour.

In the atmosphere the relative humidity of the air is increased, and condensation results when air temperature is reduced to the dew point or when sufficient water vapour is added to saturate the air.
