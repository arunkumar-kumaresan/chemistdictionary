Geochemistry is the science that uses the tools and principles of chemistry to explain the mechanisms behind major geological systems.

The realm of geochemistry extends beyond the Earth, encompassing the entire Solar System.

It is an integrated field of chemistry and geology or geography.

### Sub-fields

- Aqueous geochemistry\-Studies the role of various elements in watersheds, and how elemental fluxes are exchanged through atmospheric-terrestrial-aquatic interactions.
- Biogeochemistry\-The field of study focusing on the effect of life on the chemistry of the Earth.
- Cosmo-chemistry includes the analysis of the distribution of elements and their isotopes in the cosmos.
- Isotope geochemistry\-Determination of the relative and absolute concentrations of the elements and their isotopes in the Earth and on Earth's surface.
- Organic geochemistry\-the study of the role of processes and compounds that are derived from living or once-living organisms.
- Photo-geochemistry\-The study of light-induced chemical reactions that occur among natural components of the Earth's surface.
- Regional geochemistry \-Includes applications to environmental, hydrological and mineral exploration studies.
