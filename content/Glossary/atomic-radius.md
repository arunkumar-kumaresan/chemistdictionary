Atomic radius is the distance from the centre of the nucleus to the boundary of the surrounding shells of [electrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron/). 

Under most definitions, the radii of isolated neutral atoms range between 30 and 300 pm, or between 0.3 and 3 angstroms.

Therefore, the radius of an [atom](https://chemistdictionary.com/atom-2/) is more than 10,000 times the radius of its nucleus (1–10 fm), and less than 1/1000 of the wavelength of visible light (400–700 nm).

### History

In 1920, shortly after it had become possible to determine the sizes of atoms using X-ray crystallography, it was suggested that all atoms of the same element have the same radii.

### Various definitions of atomic radius

- Van der Waals radius: In this principle, atomic radius is half the minimum distance between the nuclei of two atoms of the element that are not bound to the same molecule.
- Ionic radius: The spacing between two adjacent oppositely charged ions should equal the sum of their ionic radii.
- Covalent radius: The distance between two atoms that are bound to each other in a molecule should equal the sum of their covalent radii.
- Metallic radius: The nominal radius of atoms of an element when joined to other atoms by metallic bonds.
- Bohr radius: The radius of the lowest-energy electron orbit predicted by the Bohr model of the atom.
