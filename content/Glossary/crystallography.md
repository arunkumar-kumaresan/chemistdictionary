Crystallography is a branch of science that deals with discerning the arrangement and bonding of atoms, in crystalline solids with the geometric structure of crystal lattices.

Modern crystallography is largely based on the analysis of the diffraction of  X-rays by crystals acting as optical gratings.

Diffraction patterns arise from the constructive interference of incident radiation (x-rays, electrons, neutrons), scattered by the periodic, repeating features of the sample.

Using X-ray crystallography, chemists are able to determine the internal structures and bonding arrangements of minerals and molecules.

Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography, the study of crystals was based on physical measurements of their geometry using a goniometer.

### History

 The word "crystallography" is derived from the Greek words _crystallon_,meaning cold drop, frozen drop, with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and _graphein_ "to write".
