Freezing is a phase transition where a liquid turns into a solid when its temperature is lowered below its freezing point.

For most substances, the melting and freezing points are the same temperature.

However, certain substances possess differing solid-liquid transition temperatures.

### Freezing techniques

This process depends on the type of matter used.

### 1\. Crystallization

Most liquids freeze by crystallization, the formation of crystalline solid from the uniform liquid.

The temperature of the whole system remains very nearly equal to the melting point due to the slow removal of [heat](https://chemistdictionary.com/heat/) when in contact with air, which is a poor heat conductor. 

### 2\. Supercooling

 Crystallization of pure liquids usually begins at a lower temperature than the melting point, due to high activation energy of homogeneous nucleation. The creation of a nucleus implies the formation of an interface at the boundaries of the new phase.

It does not start until the temperature is low enough to provide enough energy to form stable nuclei.

### 3\. Exothermicity

In this process, when the liquid changes into solid, heat and pressure are released.

Heat must be continually removed from the freezing liquid or the freezing process will stop.

The energy released upon freezing is a latent heat, and is known as the enthalpy of fusion and is exactly the same as the energy required to melt the same amount of the solid.

### 4\. Fractional freezing

This is a process used in process engineering and [ch](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemistry/)[e](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemistry/)[mistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemistry/) to separate substances with different melting points.

### 5\. Flash freezing

Flash freezing refers to the process whereby objects are frozen in just a few hours by subjecting them to cryogenic temperatures, or through direct contact with liquid nitrogen at −196 °C (−320.8 °F).
