The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to deformation at a given rate. For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of thickness.

The SI unit of dynamic viscosity is the newton-second per square meter (N·s/m2), also frequently expressed in the equivalent forms pascal-second (Pa·s).

A rheometer is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and viscometer to measure the viscosity of a fluid in flow conditions.

Viscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal frictional force that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. 

A fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids. 

A fluid with a high viscosity, such as pitch, may appear to be a solid and the second law of thermodynamics requires all fluids to have positive viscosity, such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid.

Viscosity is the material property which characterizes momentum transport within a fluid, just as thermal conductivity characterizes heat transport.

### Etymology

The word viscositynis derived from the Latin __viscum__ ("mistletoe"). _Viscum_ also referred to a viscous glue derived from mistletoe berries.
