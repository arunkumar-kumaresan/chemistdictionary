Raoult's law is a phenomenological law that assumes ideal behaviour based on the simple microscopic assumption.

Raoult's law is a law of thermodynamics established by French chemist François-Marie Raoult in 1887.

It depicts that the [intermolecular forces](https://chemistdictionary.com/intermolecular-force/) between unlike molecules are equal to those between similar molecules, which is the conditions of an ideal solution. 

This is analogous to the [ideal gas law](https://chemistdictionary.com/ideal-gas-law/), which is a limiting law valid when the interactive forces between molecules approach zero.

The more similar the components are, the more their behaviour approaches described by Raoult's law.

### Statement

Raoult's law states that the partial pressure of each component of an ideal mixture of liquid is equal to the vapour pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the mixture. 

Mathematically, Raoult's law for a single component in an ideal solution is stated as:

**Pi = Pi\*Xi**

Where,

Pi is the partial pressure of component i in gaseous mixture.

Pi\* is the equilibrium vapour pressure of the pure component.

Xi is the mole fraction of the component i.
