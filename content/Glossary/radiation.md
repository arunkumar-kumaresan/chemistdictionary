Radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium.

In other words, it is the flow of atomic and subatomic particles and of waves, such as heat rays, light rays, and X rays.

Radiation may be the energy in motion at speeds equal to the speed of light in free space, approximately 3 × 1010 centimetres (186,000 miles) per second.

### Types of radiation

Radiation may be of different types based on their emissions.

### 1\. Ionizing radiations

Ionizing radiations are those that carry sufficient energy to detach electrons from atoms or molecules. It is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atom moving at high speeds.

### 2\. Non-ionizing radiation

Non-ionizing radiation does not carry enough energy per quantum (photon energy) to ionize atoms or molecules. Non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation has sufficient energy only for excitation for the movement of an electron to a higher energy state.
