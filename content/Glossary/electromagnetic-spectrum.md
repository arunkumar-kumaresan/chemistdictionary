The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of frequencies (the spectrum) of electromagnetic radiation and their respective wavelengths and photon energies.

The electromagnetic spectrum covers electromagnetic waves with frequencies ranging from below one hertz to above 1025 hertz.

These waves in each of bands have different characteristics, such as how they are produced, how they interact with matter and their practical applications. 

Electromagnetic radiation is the flow of energy at the universal speed of light through free space or through a material medium in the form of the electric and magnetic fields.

An electromagnetic wave is characterized by its intensity and the frequency of the time variation of the electric and magnetic fields.

The spectrum of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation extends from very low to higher values from radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.

When electromagnetic radiation impinges on the matter, it causes the charged particles to oscillate and gain energy. It could be immediately re-radiated and appear as scattered, reflected, or transmitted radiation.

### History

Electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than those of visible light were discovered in the early 19th century.

The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to astronomer William Herschel, who published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London.
