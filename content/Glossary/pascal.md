Pascal is the SI derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure, stress, Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength. It is represented by the symbol Pa.

The unit of measurement called standard atmosphere (atm) is defined as 101325 Pa. 

Common multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal (1 hPa = 100 Pa), which is equal to one millibar, and the kilopascal (1 kPa = 1000 Pa), which is equal to one centibar.

One pascal is the pressure exerted by a force of magnitude one Newton perpendicularly upon an area of one square metre.

The pascal is also equivalent to the SI unit of energy density, the joule per cubic metre. This applies to the thermodynamics of pressurised gases, and energy density of electric, magnetic, gravitational fields.

### Etymology

The unit is named after Blaise Pascal, noted for his contributions to hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, and experiments with a barometer. 

The name pascal was adopted for the SI unit newton per square metre (N/m2) by the 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1971.
