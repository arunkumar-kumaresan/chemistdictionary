A dimer is an oligomer consisting of two monomers joined by [bonds](https://chemistdictionary.com/bond/).

The bonds may be strong or weak, covalent or intermolecular.

An oligomer is a molecule that consists of a few identical repeating units which could be derived.

The term homo-dimer is used when the two molecules are identical (e.g. A–A) and heterodimer when they are not (e.g. A–B). 

### Major classification of dimers

### 1\. Covalent dimers

Covalent dimers are not structurally similar to their monomers.

Many nonmetallic elements occur as dimers such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, the [halogens](https://chemistdictionary.com/halogens/).

### 2\. Non- covalent dimers

Hydrogen bonds are usually formed in non-covalent dimers.

For example, acetic acid forms a dimer in the gas phase, where the monomer units are held together by hydrogen bonds.
