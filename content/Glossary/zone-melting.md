Zone melting is a group of similar methods of purifying [crystals](https://chemistdictionary.com/crystal/), in which a narrow region of a crystal is melted, and this molten zone is moved along the crystal. 

Zone melting is also referred to as **zone refining** or **floating-zone process** or **travelling melting zone**, particularly in [semiconductor](https://chemistdictionary.com/semiconductor/) materials processing.

The molten region melts impure solid at its forward edge and leaves a wake of purer material solidified behind it as it moves through the ingot. 

The impurities that are concentrated in the melt, are moved to one end of the ingot, later on, the process. The ingot is a pure substance used for transportation and processing.

In zone refining, solutes are segregated at one end of the ingot in order to purify the remainder or to concentrate the impurities.

Heaters are used for zone melting, with their most important characteristic being the ability to form short molten zones that move slowly and uniformly through the ingot.

Induction coils, ring-wound resistance heaters, or gas flames are common methods.

And the other type of heaters are optical heaters and passing an electric current through ingot when it is placed in a magnetic field.

Zone melting can be done as a batch process, or it can be done continuously, with fresh impure material being continually added at one end and purer material being removed from the other.

### History

Zone refining was invented by John Desmond Bernal and further developed by William Gardner Pfann as a method to prepare high purity materials, mainly semiconductors, for manufacturing transistors. 

Its first commercial use was in germanium, refined to one atom of impurity per ten billion, but the process can be extended to virtually any solute-solvent system.
