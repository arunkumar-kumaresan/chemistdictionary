A mineral a solid chemical compound that occurs naturally in homogeneous solid with definite chemical composition and a highly ordered atomic arrangement.

The term "mineral" is usually reserved for mineral species that are crystalline compounds with a specific crystal structure.

Besides the essential chemical composition and crystal structure, the description of a mineral species usually includes physical properties such as:

- Habit
- Hardness
- Lustre
- Di-aphaneity
- Colour
- Magnetism
- Radio-activity
- Tenacity, etc,.

Minerals are classified by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are The Dana classification and The Strunz classification. 

Minerals have been described as resulting exclusively from inorganic processes. However, the current mineralogical practice includes minerals as the compounds that are organically produced to satisfy other mineral requirements. 

### Formation of minerals

Minerals form in all geologic environments under a wide range of chemical and physical conditions, such as varying temperature and pressure.

1. Igneous or magmatic minerals: In this, the minerals crystallize from a melt.
2. Sedimentary Minerals: Minerals formed as a result of sedimentation, a process whose raw materials are particles from other rocks that have undergone weathering or erosion.
3. Metamorphic minerals: New minerals form at the expense of earlier ones owing to the effects of changing(usually increasing temperature or pressure).
4. Hydrothermic minerals: In this, the minerals are chemically precipitated from hot solutions within Earth.
