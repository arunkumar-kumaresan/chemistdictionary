A nonmetal is typically brittle when solid and usually has poor thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity. 

Non-metals are chemical elements that mostly lack the characteristics of a [metal](https://chemistdictionary.com/metal/). Physically, a nonmetal tends to have a relatively low melting point, [boiling point](https://chemistdictionary.com/metal/), and [density](https://chemistdictionary.com/boiling-point/). 

These tend to have relatively high [ionization](https://chemistdictionary.com/ionisation/) energy, electron affinity and [electronegativity](https://chemistdictionary.com/electronegativity/). They gain or share electrons when they react with other elements and chemical compounds.

Like metals, nonmetals may occur in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state. Many nonmetals have less stable [allotropes](https://chemistdictionary.com/allotrope/), with either nonmetallic or metallic properties.

Non-metals form many more compounds than metals. Metalloids such as [boron](https://chemistdictionary.com/boron/), silicon, and germanium are sometimes counted as nonmetals.

### Types of non-metals

The nonmetals are divided into two categories reflecting their relative propensity to form chemical compounds.

### 1\. Reactive non-metals

The reactive nonmetals vary in their nonmetallic character. The more electronegative of the reactive nonmetals are characterised by stronger nonmetallic properties and a tendency to form predominantly ionic compounds with metals.

### 2\. Noble gases

The noble gases are distinguished by their great reluctance to form compounds with other elements. These gases have negative electron affinities.
