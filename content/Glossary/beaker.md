 A beaker is a cylindrical container with a flat bottom.

A beak or spout is found at the top to aid pouring.

A beaker is distinguished from a [flask](https://chemistdictionary.com/aboratory-flask/) by having straight rather than sloping sides.

### Material used in beakers

Beakers are commonly made of glass(borosilicate glass).

Metal beakers are made up of metals such as stainless steel or aluminium.

Certain plastic beakers use polythene, polypropylene, PTFE. 

### Construction

Standard or low-form beakers typically have a height about 1.4 times the diameter.

Tall-form beakers have a height about twice their diameter.

Flat beakers are often called crystallizers because most are used to perform crystallization, but they are also often used as a vessel for use in hot-bath heating. These beakers usually do not have a flat scale.

The presence of a spout means that the beaker cannot have a lid.

However, while using, beakers may be covered by a watch glass to prevent contamination or loss of the contents, but allowing venting via the spout.
