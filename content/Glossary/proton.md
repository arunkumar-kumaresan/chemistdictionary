A proton is a subatomic particle with a positive electric charge.

It's mass slightly less than that of a neutron.

Every nucleus of a given chemical element has the same number of protons.

When the number of protons in a nucleus equals the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus, the atom is electrically neutral.

Protons also have extrasolar origin from galactic cosmic rays.

The rest mass of proton is 1.67262 × 10−27 Kg.

The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom gives the atomic number.

### History

The word _proton_ is from Greek, meaning "first".

This name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920.
