A watch glass is a circular concave piece of glass used in [chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemistry/) as a surface to evaporate, hold substances, while being weighed, for heating a small amount of substance and as a cover for a [beaker](https://chemistdictionary.com/beaker/). 

When used as an evaporation surface, a watch glass allows closer observation of [precipitates](https://chemistdictionary.com/precipitate/) or crystallization, and can be placed on a surface of contrasting color to improve the visibility.

Watch glasses are named so because they are similar to the [glass](https://chemistdictionary.com/glass/) used for the front of old-fashioned pocket watches.

One of the generic uses of a watch glass as mentioned previously includes as a lid for beakers. In this case, it is placed above the container, which makes easier to control and alter vapour saturation conditions.

A watch glass is not only used for observing precipitation patterns and [crystals](https://chemistdictionary.com/crystal/), but it can also be used for drying solids.

### Types of watch glasses

Watch glasses are usually thicker than any other glass or plastic labware. There are two types of watch glasses used in the laboratory, which include:

### 1\. Glass watch glass

This can be reused after it is sterilized in an autoclave or a laboratory oven. The glasses made provide high resistance to thermal shock, chemical resistance and withstand mechanical durability.

### 2\. Plastic watch glass

Plastic watch glasses are disposable watch-glass used in laboratory work to avoid any cross-contamination while preparing the samples. They are very good at implementing in low temperatures.

These plastic watch glasses are less expensive and light in weight.
