A cathode is an electrode through which conventional current leaves a polarized electrode. In other words, it is a metal wire or plate, having an excess negative charge. The cathode is the terminal part of a device.  
Reduction occurs here. The reduction is the process of accepting [electrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron/).

## Types of cathode

**Hot cathode**

It is heated by a filament to produce electrons by thermionic emission.

**Directly heated cathode**

The filament itself is the cathode and emits the electrons directly.

**Indirectly heated cathode**

The filament is not the cathode but it heats the cathode in return which then emits electrons.

**Cold cathode**

In this, the cathode is not heated through a filament. They emit electrons by field-effect emission.
