Chemical equilibrium in a [chemical reaction](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-reaction/) represents no net change in the amounts of reactants and products occurs. 

This state results when the forward reaction proceeds at the same rate as the reverse reaction.

The reaction rates of the forward and backward reactions are generally not zero, but equal.

At this point, the reaction may be considered to be completed.

The conditions that pertain to equilibrium may be given by the quantitative formulation. 

### History

The concept of chemical equilibrium was developed after Berthollet (1803) found that some chemical reactions are reversible.

### Types of equlibrium

Equilibrium can be broadly classified as heterogeneous and homogeneous equilibrium.

### 1\. Homogeneous equlibrium

This consists of reactants and products belonging in the same phase.

Example: Reactions that take place in solids, liquids and gases.

### 2\. Heterogeneous equlibrium

This comprises of reactants and products in a different phase.

Example: Reactions that includes a combination of the states of the matter.
