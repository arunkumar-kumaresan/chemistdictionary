Titration is a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis to determine the [concentration](https://chemistdictionary.com/concentration/) of an identified analyte (a substance to be analyzed).

It is also known as volumetric analysis or titrimetry, in which, a reagent, termed the titrant or titrator is prepared as a standard solution of known concentration and volume.

The titrant reacts with a solution of analyte (which may also be termed the titrand) to determine the analyte's concentration. 

A typical titration begins with a [beaker](https://chemistdictionary.com/beaker/) or Erlenmeyer flask containing a very precise amount of the analyte and a small amount of indicator.

This process takes place underneath a calibrated [burette](https://chemistdictionary.com/burette/) or chemistry pipetting syringe containing the titrant. Small volumes of the titrant are added until the indicator colour is changed.

Indicator colour change in the reaction, at the titrant saturation threshold, represents the endpoint of the titration, meaning the amount of titrant balances the amount of analyte present.

A titration curve is a curve in the graph the _x_ and y-coordinates represent the volume of titrant, since the beginning of the titration and concentration of the analyte at the corresponding stage of the titration respectively.

### Types of titration

There are many types of titrations with different procedures and goals. The most common types of qualitative titration are:

- Acid-base titrations: Depend on the neutralization between an [acid](https://chemistdictionary.com/acid/) and a [base](https://chemistdictionary.com/base/) when mixed in solution. The acid-base indicator indicates the endpoint of the titration by changing colour.
- Redox titrations: Based on a reduction-oxidation reaction between an [oxidizing agent](https://chemistdictionary.com/oxidizing-agents/) and a [reducing agent](https://chemistdictionary.com/reducing-agent/). A potentiometer or a redox indicator is usually used to determine the endpoint of the titration.
