An intramolecular force is any force that binds together the atoms making up a molecule or compound. These forces are often stronger than [intermolecular forces](https://chemistdictionary.com/intermolecular-force/).

The bonds formed are distinguished by the degree of charge separation between participating atoms.

### History

The name comes from the Latin roots of English with intra meaning as _inside_.

### Types

The characteristics of the bond formed can be predicted by the properties of constituent atoms, namely [electronegativity](https://chemistdictionary.com/electronegativity/).

- Ionic bond - Transfer of one or more valence electrons of atoms participating in bond formation.
- [Covalent bond](https://chemistdictionary.com/covalent-bond/) - Formed between two nonmetals. 
- Metallic bond - form within a pure metal or metal alloy which are generally delocalized.
