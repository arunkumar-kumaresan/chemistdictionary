A valence electron is an outer shell [electron](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron/) that is associated with an atom, and that can participate in the formation of a [chemical bond](https://chemistdictionary.com/bond/) if the outer shell is not closed.

The presence of valence electrons can determine the element's chemical properties, such as its valence it may bond with other elements or not.

An atom with a closed shell of valence electrons tend to be chemically inert but, atoms with one or two valence electrons, are highly reactive due to the relatively low energy.

A valence electron has the ability to absorb or release energy in the form of a [photon](https://chemistdictionary.com/photon/). An energy gain can trigger the electron to move to an outer shell.

The number of valence electrons corresponding to each group in the [periodic table](https://chemistdictionary.com/periodic-table/) is given by:

Periodic table group

Valence electrons

Group 1 (I) (alkali metals)

1

Group 2 (II) (alkaline earth metals) and helium

2

Lanthanides and actinides

3–16

Groups 3-12 (transition metals)

3–12

Group 13 (III) (boron group)

3

Group 14 (IV) (carbon group)

4

Group 15 (V) (pnictogens or nitrogen group)

5

Group 16 (VI) (chalcogens or oxygen group)

6

Group 17 (VII) (halogens)

7

Group 18 (VIII or 0) (noble gases) except helium

8

Valence electrons are also responsible for the electrical conductivity of an element. As a result, an element may be classified as a [metal](https://chemistdictionary.com/metal/), a [nonmetal](https://chemistdictionary.com/non-metals/), or a [semiconductor](https://chemistdictionary.com/semiconductor/).
