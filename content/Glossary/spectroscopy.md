Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation as a function of its wavelength or frequency.

Spectroscopic data are often represented by an emission spectrum, a plot of the response of interest, as a function of wavelength or frequency.

One of the central concepts in spectroscopy is [resonance](https://chemistdictionary.com/resonance/) and its corresponding resonant frequency, which were characterized in mechanical systems as pendulums. 

In quantum mechanical systems, the analogous resonance is a coupling of two quantum mechanical stationary states of one system via an oscillatory source of energy.

### Classification

The various implementations and techniques can be classified in several ways.

### 1\. Based on radiative energy

The types of spectroscopy are distinguished by the type of radiative energy involved in the interaction. 

- Electromagnetic radiation is classified by the wavelength region of the spectrum and includes infrared, near-infrared, ultraviolet-visible, x-ray, and gamma spectroscopy.
- Particles involve because of their de Broglie waves, can also be a source of radiative energy.
- Acoustic spectroscopy involves radiated pressure waves.
- Dynamic mechanical analysis can be employed to impart radiating energy, similar to acoustic waves, to solid materials.

### 2\. Based on the nature of interaction

The types of spectroscopy also can be distinguished by the nature of the interaction between the energy and the material.

- Absorption spectroscopy: Absorption occurs when energy from the radiative source is absorbed by the material.
- Emission spectroscopy: Emission indicates that radiative energy is released by the material.
- Elastic scattering and reflection spectroscopy determine how incident radiation is reflected or scattered by a material. 
- Impedance spectroscopy: Impedance is the ability of a medium to impede or slow the transmittance of energy.
- Nuclear spectroscopy is methods that use the properties of specific nuclei to probe.
