Lattice is an imaginary geometric concept. It is a large assembly of points in which each point represents position and orientation of an atom in a [crystal](https://chemistdictionary.com/crystal/).

Lattice

Space lattice is an array of points to represent the atoms in a crystal in which the environment about each point is the same.

A crystal is considered to be an array in three dimensions. So it is necessary to consider lattice concepts to analyse the crystal. The points in a space lattice are said to be lattice points and the line joining the lattice points is lattice lines. Lattice plane is a plane that is comprised of lattice points.

Bravais lattice, named after Auguste Bravais is an infinite array of discrete points generated by a set of discrete translation operations described in three-dimensional space.

A unit cell is one in which it is made up of only one lattice point, this is said to be a primitive unit cell and in case of a non-primitive unit cell, extra lattice points are present.

### Classification of Lattice

Based on the unit cells, the crystals are classified into seven types. Here, the three planes are considered as a,b,c respectively and the angle formed between these planes are α, β and γ.

**STRUCTURE**

**PLANE ARRANGEMENT**

**ANGLE FORMATION**

Simple cubic

a = b= c

α = β = γ= 90°

Tetragonal

a = b ≠ c

α = β = γ = 90°

Orthorhombic

a ≠ b ≠ c

α = β = γ = 90°

Rhombohedral

a = b = c

α = β = γ ≠ 90°

Monoclinic

a ≠ b ≠ c

α = γ = 90°,  
β ≠ 90°

Triclinic

a ≠ b ≠ c

α ≠ β ≠ γ ≠ 90°

Hexagonal

a = b ≠ c

α = β = 90°,  
γ ≠ 120°
