Thermochemistry is the study of the heat energy which is associated with [chemical reactions](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-reaction/) and physical transformations.

Thermochemistry focuses on these energy changes, particularly on the system's energy exchange with its surroundings. 

This study coalesces the concepts of thermodynamics with the concept of energy in the form of [chemical](https://chemistdictionary.com/bond/) [bonds](https://chemistdictionary.com/bond/). 

This in combination with entropy determinations, it is also used to predict whether a reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous, favourable or unfavourable.

### History

Thermochemistry rests on two generalizations stated in modern terms. They are as follows:

1. Lavoisier and Laplace's law: The energy change accompanying any transformation is equal and opposite to energy change accompanying the reverse process.
2. Hess' law: The energy change accompanying any transformation is the same whether the process occurs in one step or many.
