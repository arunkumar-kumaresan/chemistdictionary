A **molecule** is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds.

Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge.

Molecules are held together by either covalent bonding or ionic bonding. 

### History

In French the word  _molécule_ refers to the extremely minute particle.

From New Latin molecule is referred as _molecula_, diminutive of Latin _moles_ "mass, barrier".

### Classification of molecules

Molecules are classified based on the atomicity.

Atomicity refers to the number of atoms constituting a molecule.

### 1\. Monoatomic molecules

In monoatomic molecules, a molecule is composed of only one atom.

Hence, this molecule can also be called an atom.

Example includes Helium(He), Argon(Ar), etc.

### 2\. Diatomic molecules

Molecules that are composed of two atoms is said to diatomic.

For example, Chlorine (Cl2), Nitrogen (N2) etc.

### 3\. Triatomic molecules

A molecule which has three atoms in it is called as triatomic molecules

Example: O3, H2O.

### 4\. Polyatomic molecules

Polyatomic molecules has more than three atoms composed in it.

Example: Phosphorus (P4), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),etc.
