A pipette is a laboratory tool commonly used in [chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemistry/), biology and medicine to transport a measured volume of liquid, often as a media dispenser.

Many pipette types work by creating a partial vacuum above the liquid-holding chamber and selectively releasing this vacuum to draw up.

Measurement accuracy varies greatly depending on the style of the pipette.

### History

The first micropipette was patented in 1957 by Dr Heinrich Schnitger.

The first simple pipettes were made in [glass](https://chemistdictionary.com/glass/), such as Pasteur pipettes. Large pipettes continue to be made in glass and others are made in squeezable plastic.

The adjustable micropipette is a Wisconsin invention developed through interactions among several people.

### Types of Pipette

Pipettes come in several designs for various purposes with differing levels of accuracy and precision.

### Air displacement micro-pipette

Air displacement micro-pipettes is a type of adjustable micropipette that deliver a measured volume of liquid. These pipettes require disposable tips that come in contact with the fluid. 

### Electronic pipette

Electronic pipettes can decrease the risk of RSI-type injuries. The manual movement of the piston is replaced by a small electric motor powered by a battery.

Whereas manual pipettes need a movement of the thumb, electronic pipettes have the main button. The programming of the pipette is generally done by a control wheel and some further buttons. 

### Volumetric pipettes

Volumetric or bulb pipettes have a large bulb with a long narrow portion above with a single graduation mark as it is calibrated for a single volume.

### Graduated pipette

Graduated pipettes are a type of macro-pipette consisting of a long tube with a series of graduations, to indicate different calibrated volumes. 

### Pasteur pipette

Pasteur pipettes are also called teat pipettes, droppers, eye droppers and chemical droppers are made up of plastic or glass pipettes used to transfer small amounts of liquids.

### Glass micro-pipette

Glass micro-pipettes are fabricated in a micropipette puller and are typically used in a micromanipulator.

### Micro-fluidic pipette

Invented by Alar Ainla, currently situated in the Biophysical Technology Lab. It is a recent introduction into the micropipette field integrates the versatility of microfluidics into a freely positionable pipette platform. 

### Van Slyke pipette

A graduated pipette commonly used in medical technology with serologic pipettes for volumetric analysis. 

### Ostwald–Folin pipette

A special pipette used in measuring viscous fluid such as whole blood. Common in medical technology laboratory setups together with other pipettes.
