## About Lithium

Lithium is a chemical element with symbol Li and atomic number 3. Classified as an alkali metal, lithium is a solid at room temperature.

## History

The name derives from the Latin _lithos_ for "stone" because lithium was thought to exist only in minerals at that time. It was discovered by the Swedish mineralogist Johan August Arfwedson in 1818 in the mineral petalite LiAl(Si2O5)2. Lithium was isolated in 1855 by the German chemists Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen.

## Sources

It does not occur freely in nature; combined, it is found in small units in nearly all igneous rocks and in many mineral springs. Lepidolite, spodumene, petalite, and amblygonite are the more important minerals containing it.  
Lithium is presently being recovered from brines of Searles Lake, in California, and from those in Nevada. Large deposits of quadramene are found in North Carolina. The metal is produced electrolytically from the fused chloride.

## Isotopes

Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li the latter being the more abundant (92.5% natural abundance).  
7Li is one of the primordial elements (or, more properly, primordial nuclides) produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis. A small amount of both 6Li and 7Li are produced in stars but are thought to be "burned" as fast as produced. Additional small amounts of lithium of both 6Li and 7Li may be generated from the solar wind, cosmic rays hitting heavier atoms, and from early solar system 7Be and **10**Be radioactive decay. While lithium is created in stars during stellar nucleosynthesis, it is further burned. 7Li can also be generated in carbon stars.

## Uses

- Lithium has the highest specific heat of any solid element and is used in heat transfer applications.
- It is used to make special glasses and ceramics, including the Mount Palomar telescope's 200 inch mirror.
- Lithium is the lightest known metal and can be alloyed with aluminium, copper, manganese, and cadmium to make strong, lightweight metals for aircraft.
- Lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is used to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of spacecraft.
- Lithium stearate (LiC18H35O2) is used as a general purpose and high temperature lubricant.
- Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) is used as a drug to treat manic depression disorder.
- It has the highest specific heat of any solid element, it has found use in heat transfer applications; however, it is corrosive and requires special handling.
- The metal has been used as an alloying agent, is of interest in synthesis of organic compounds, and has nuclear applications.
