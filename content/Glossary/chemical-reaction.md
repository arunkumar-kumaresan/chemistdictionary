A **chemical reaction** is a process that leads to the chemical transformation of one set of chemical substances to another.

Chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei, and can often be described by a chemical equation. 

The substance initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents.

Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration. 

Chemical reactions are determined by the laws of thermodynamics.

Reactions can proceed by themselves if they are exergonic, that is if they release energy.

The associated free energy of the reaction is composed of two different thermodynamic quantities, enthalpy and entropy

### Representation of chemical reaction

Chemical equations are used to graphically illustrate chemical reactions.

They consist of chemical or structural formulae of the reactants on the left and those of the products on the right.

H2 + O2 → H2O

In the above chemical equation, H2 and O2 are reactants and H2O is the product.
