Organic chemistry is a branch of [chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemistry/) that studies the structure, properties and reactions of organic compounds, involving [carbon](https://chemistdictionary.com/carbon/) in covalent bonding.

Organic chemistry is the Chemistry of Life because all of the [molecules](https://chemistdictionary.com/molecule/) that make up living tissue have carbon.

The study of organic chemistry overlaps organometallic chemistry and [biochemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/biochemistry/), along with medicinal chemistry, polymer chemistry, and materials science.

The organic reactions are studied by the chemical synthesis of natural products, drugs, and polymers, and even individual organic molecules in the laboratory and via theoretical study.

### History

 According to the concept of vitalism (vital force theory), organic matter was endowed with a "vital force".

Around 1816 Michel Chevreul started a study of soaps made from various fats and alkalis. 

Early examples of organic reactions and applications were often found because of a combination of luck and preparation for unexpected observations.

The latter half of the 19th century however witnessed systematic studies of organic compounds.
