An **electron shell** may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom's nucleus. 

Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons.

 The first shell can hold up to 2 electrons, the second shell can hold up to eight (2 + 6) electrons and goes on.

 The general formula is that the _n_th shell can in principle hold up to 2(_n_2) electrons.

Each shell consists of one or more subshells, and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals.

The shells are labelled alphabetically with the letters used in X-ray notation (K, L, M, …).

The closest shell to the nucleus is called the 1st shell (K shell), followed by the 2nd shell (L shell), then the 3rd shell (or M shell), and so on.

### History

The shell terminology comes from Arnold Sommerfeld's modification of the Bohr model. Sommerfeld retained Bohr's planetary model but added mildly elliptical orbits.
