Solid is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being [liquid](https://chemistdictionary.com/liquid/), [gas](https://chemistdictionary.com/gas/) and [plasma](https://chemistdictionary.com/plasma/)) wherein, the molecules in a solid are closely packed together.

A solid is characterized by structural rigidity and resistance to a force applied to the surface. 

The atoms in a solid are bound to each other, either in a regular geometric lattice (crystalline solids), or irregularly (amorphous solids).

Solids that are formed by slow cooling will tend to be crystalline, while solids that are rapid cooling are more likely to be amorphous. 

### Properties

Solids have thermal energy, so their atoms vibrate about fixed mean positions within the ordered (or disordered) lattice. 

Solids can transmit or reflect visible light.

It has higher [densities](https://chemistdictionary.com/density/) and strong [intermolecular](https://chemistdictionary.com/intermolecular-force/) [forces](https://chemistdictionary.com/intermolecular-force/).

Generally, solids have higher melting and boiling points.

### Classification of solids

Solids are generally divided into three broad classes, namely:

- Crystalline solids: These have a very high degree of order in a periodic atomic arrangement.
- Amorphous solids: Solids in which atoms and molecules are not organized in a definite lattice pattern. 
- Quasi-crystalline solids: This sort of solids display novel symmetries in which the atoms are arranged in quasiperiodic fashion.
