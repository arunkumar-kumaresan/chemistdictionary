A period in the [periodic table](https://chemistdictionary.com/periodic-table/) is a row of chemical elements. All elements in a row have the same number of [electron shells](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron-shell/).

Each next element in a period has one more [proton](https://chemistdictionary.com/proton/) and is less metallic than its predecessor.

In the s-block and [p-block](https://chemistdictionary.com/p-block/) of the periodic table, elements within the same period generally do not exhibit trends and similarities in properties.

### Periods

There are currently seven complete periods in the periodic table, comprising the 118 known elements. The periods 1,2,3 are called as short period and the period 4,5 are considered to be long period and 6,7 are referred to as the longest period.

- Period 1: It contains two elements, [hydrogen](https://chemistdictionary.com/hydrogen/) and [helium](https://chemistdictionary.com/helium/).
- Period 2: Atomic number from 3-10 with eight elements from [Lithium](https://chemistdictionary.com/lithium/) to Neon.
- Period 3: Comprises eight elements from Sodium to Argon from the Atomic number 11 to 18.
- Period 4: In this, atomic number ranges from 19-36 and has eighteen elements.
- Period 5: Atomic number from 37-54 with eight normal elements and ten transition elements.
- Period 6: In this, the Atomic number starts from 55 and ends in 86. It has thirty two elements with eight normal elements, 10 transition elements and 14 inner transition elements.
- Period 7: Like the sixth period, this also contains 32 elements and all are radioactive.
- Period 8: No element of the eighth period has yet been synthesized. It is not clear if all elements predicted for the eighth period are in fact physically possible.
