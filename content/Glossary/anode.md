An anode is an electrode through which a conventional current enters a polarized electrode. In other words, it is a metal wire or plate, having an excess positive charge.

## Types of anode:

1. **Electrolytic anode** \-  At the anode, anions (negative ions) are forced by the electrical potential to react chemically and give off electrons (oxidation) which then flow up and into the driving circuit. It is widely used in metal refining. 
2. **Battery/ Galvanic cell anode** - The anode is the negative electrode from which electrons flow out towards the external part of the circuit.
3. **Vacuum tube anode** \- The anode is a charged positive plate that collects the electrons emitted by the cathode through electric attraction which acts as an electric collector.
4. **Sacrificial anode** - In this, a metal anode that is more reactive to the corrosive environment of the system to be protected is electrically linked to the protected system, and partially corrodes or dissolves, which protects the metal of the system it is connected to.
