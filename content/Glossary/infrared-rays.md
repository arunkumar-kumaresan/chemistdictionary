Infrared rays are electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with wavelengths longer than those of visible light. It is therefore generally invisible to the human eye.

IR wavelengths extend from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers (frequency 430 THz), to 1 millimetre (300 THz).

Infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their rotational-vibrational movements. Infrared spectroscopy is used to examine the absorption of [photons](https://chemistdictionary.com/photon/).

Sunlight, at an effective temperature of 5780 kelvins is composed of near-thermal-spectrum radiation that is slightly more than half infrared.

Some thermal radiation consists of infrared in the mid-infrared region, much longer than in sunlight. However, black-body or thermal radiation is continuous that gives off radiation at all [wavelengths](https://chemistdictionary.com/wavelength/).

### History

The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to William Herschel, the astronomer, in the early 19th century. Herschel published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London.
