Photon is a type of elementary particle which is the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation.

Photons are massless, and they always move at the speed of light in vacuum, 299792458 m/s and exhibits wave-particle duality.

The photon concept has led to advances in experimental and theoretical physics, including lasers, Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum field theory, and the probabilistic interpretation of [quantum mechanics](https://chemistdictionary.com/quantum-mechanics/).

### History & Nomenclature

The name _photon_ derives from the Greek word for [light](https://chemistdictionary.com/light/). Arthur Compton used _photon_ in 1928, referring to Gilbert N. Lewis, who coined the term in a letter to Nature on December 18, 1926.

A photon is usually denoted by the symbol γ. This symbol for the photon probably derives from gamma rays.

### Properties

The photon is the gauge boson for electromagnetism, and therefore all other quantum numbers of the photon are zero.

The photon does not obey the Pauli exclusion principle but instead obeys Bose-Einstein statistics.

Photons can also be emitted when a particle and its corresponding antiparticle are annihilated.

The photon also carries a quantity called spin angular momentum that does not depend on its frequency.
