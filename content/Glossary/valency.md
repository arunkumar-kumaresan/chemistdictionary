Valency of an element is a measure of its combining power with other atoms when it forms [chemical](https://chemistdictionary.com/compound/) [compounds](https://chemistdictionary.com/compound/) or [molecules](https://chemistdictionary.com/molecule/).

Valence only describes connectivity. It does not describe the geometry of molecular compounds, or what are now known to be ionic compounds.

The valence of a particular atom in a molecule is defined as the number of electrons that an atom uses in bonding.

Valences may also be different from the absolute values of oxidation states due to different polarity of bonds. 

### Calculation of valency

With two equivalent formulae, valency can be calculated.

valence = (number of electrons in the valence shell of a free atom) – (number of nonbonding electrons on an atom in a molecule).

valence = number of bonds + formal charge.
