Sublimation is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas state, without passing through the liquid state.

Sublimation is an [endothermic](https://chemistdictionary.com/endothermic-process/) [process](https://chemistdictionary.com/endothermic-process/) that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substance's triple point in its phase diagram.

The above mentioned point corresponds to the lowest pressure at which the substance can exist as a liquid.

Sublimation is caused by the absorption of heat which provides enough energy for some molecules to overcome the attractive forces of their neighbours and escape into the vapour phase. 

Digital sublimation, the process is commonly used for decorating apparel, signs and banners, as well as novelty items.

### Sublimation as a purification technique

It is a technique used by chemists to purify compounds in which, a solid is typically placed in a sublimation apparatus and heated under vacuum.

Vacuum sublimation of this type is also the method of choice for purification of [organic compounds](https://chemistdictionary.com/organic-compound/) for use in the organic electronics industry.
