Intermolecular forces (IMF) are the forces which mediate the interaction between [molecules](https://chemistdictionary.com/molecule/). It may be the forces of attraction or repulsion.

Intermolecular forces are weak relative to intramolecular forces.

### History

The first reference to the nature of microscopic forces is found in Alexis Clairaut's work _Theorie de la Figure de la Terre_.

Scientists Laplace, Gauss, Maxwell and Boltzmann have also contributed to this research.

### Types of Intermolecular force

Attractive intermolecular forces are categorized into the following types:

- Hydrogen or H-bonding - Attraction between the lone pair of an electronegative atom and a hydrogen atom that is bonded to an electronegative atom.
- Ionic bonding - The attraction between cationic and anionic sites. 
- Dipole-dipole interaction - Electrostatic interactions between molecules which have permanent dipoles.
- Van der Waals force - Interaction between uncharged atoms or molecules.
- Keesom force - These forces originate from the attraction between permanent dipoles and are temperature dependent.
- Debye force \- Interactions between rotating permanent dipoles and from the polarizability of atoms and molecules 
- London dispersion force \- Arises due to the non-zero instantaneous dipole moments of all atoms and molecules.
