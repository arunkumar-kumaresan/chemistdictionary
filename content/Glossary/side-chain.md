In [organic chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/organic-chemistry/), a side chain is a chemical group that is attached to a core part of the molecule called the main chain or backbone.

The side chain is a hydrocarbon branching element of a molecule that is attached to a larger hydrocarbon backbone.

The side chain is also known as a pendant chain, and it is a factor in determining a molecule's properties and reactivity.

In polymer science, the side chain of an oligomeric or polymeric offshoot extends from the backbone chain of a [polymer](https://chemistdictionary.com/polymer/). 

An oligomeric branch may be referred to as a short-chain branch and the polymeric branch is referred to as a long-chain branch.

The placeholder **R** is often used as a generic placeholder for alkyl (saturated hydrocarbon) group side chains in chemical structure diagrams. 

In Biochemistry, the side chain connected to the alpha-carbon is specific for each amino acid and is responsible for determining charge and polarity of the amino acid.
