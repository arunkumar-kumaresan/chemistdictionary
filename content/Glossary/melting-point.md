The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to [liquid](https://chemistdictionary.com/liquid/). 

It is also called a Liquefaction point. Considering the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the [freezing](https://chemistdictionary.com/freezing/) or crystallization point. 

The principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice is the melting point.

Because of the ability of some substances to supercool, the freezing point is not considered as a characteristic property of a substance. 

A high melting point results from a high heat of fusion, a low entropy of fusion, or a combination of both.

In highly symmetrical molecules the crystal phase is densely packed with many efficient intermolecular interactions resulting in a higher enthalpy change on melting.

In thermodynamics, heat needs to be supplied for the melting to take place, this is called the heat of fusion.
