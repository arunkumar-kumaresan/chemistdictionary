Nuclear chemistry is the sub-field of chemistry dealing with radioactivity, nuclear processes, and transformations in the nuclei of atoms.

This includes the corrosion of surfaces and the behaviour under conditions of both normal and abnormal operation.

The behaviour of objects and materials after being placed into nuclear waste storage or disposal site is taken mainly into account.

It also includes the study and use of nuclear processes in non-radioactive areas of human activity and also the production and use of radioactive sources for a range of processes. 

### History

After Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays in 1882, many scientists began to work on ionising radiation. 

One of these was Henri Becquerel when the relationship between phosphorescence and the blackening of photographic plates was investigated, radioactivity was discovered. 

In 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot-Curie were the first to create artificial radioactivity.
