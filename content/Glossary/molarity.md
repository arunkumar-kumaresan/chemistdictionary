Molarity is a measure of the concentration of a chemical species, in particular of a solute in a solution, in terms of amount of substance per unit volume of solution. 

Molar concentration or molarity is most commonly expressed in units of moles of solute per litre of solution.

In thermodynamics, the use of molar concentration is often not convenient because the volume of most solutions slightly depends on temperature.

In the International System of Units (SI) the coherent unit for molar concentration is **mol/m3**. 

The sum of molar concentrations gives the total molar concentration, namely the [density](https://chemistdictionary.com/density/) of the mixture.

The molar concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution due mainly to thermal expansion.
