Quantum is the minimum amount of any physical entity involved in an interaction. The fundamental notion that a physical property can be quantized.

This indicates the magnitude of the physical property can take on only discrete values consisting of integer multiples of one quantum.

For example, the energy of an electron bound within an atom is quantized and can exist only in certain discrete values.

All phenomena in submicroscopic systems exhibit quantization and observable quantities are restricted to a natural set of discrete values.

Quantum is the discrete natural unit, or packet of energy, charge, angular momentum, or other physical property.

### Etymology

The word _quantum_ is the neuter singular of the Latin interrogative adjective quantus, meaning "how much".

The concept of quantization of radiation was discovered in 1900 by Max Planck, who had been trying to understand the emission of radiation from heated objects, known as black-body radiation. 

Later, Max Planck postulated that electromagnetic energy is absorbed or emitted in discrete packets, or quanta.
