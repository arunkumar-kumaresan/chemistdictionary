Chemical synthesis is the construction of complex chemical compounds from simpler ones. 

 It is the process by which many substances important to daily life are obtained. 

Chemical synthesis is the artificial execution of useful chemical reactions to obtain one or several products.

The amount of product produced in a chemical synthesis is known as the reaction yield. 

### Types of synthesis

The two major synthesis are stated below.

### 1\. Organic synthesis

Organic synthesis is a special branch of chemical synthesis dealing with the synthesis of organic compounds.

 If a chemical synthesis starts from basic laboratory compounds, it is considered a purely synthetic process. 

 If it starts from a product isolated from plants or animals and then proceeds to new compounds, the synthesis is described as a semisynthetic process.

### 2\. Inorganic synthesis

Inorganic synthesis and organometallic synthesis are applied to the preparation of compounds with significant non-organic content.
