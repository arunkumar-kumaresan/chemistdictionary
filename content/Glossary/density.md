The **density** of a substance is its mass per unit volume.

It is also known as volumetric mass density or specific mass.

Density is often represented as _ρ_ (Rho).

Density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass.

### Measurement of density

Different materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. Each material's density is analysed and measured based on the following.

### 1\. Homogeneous materials

The density at all points of a homogeneous object equals its total mass divided by its total volume.

The mass is normally measured with a scale or balance.

The volume may be measured directly or by the displacement of a fluid. 

### 2\. Heterogeneous materials

 In this, the density varies between different regions of the object.

So, in that case, the density around any given location is determined by calculating the density of a small volume around that location.

### 3\. Non impact materials

In the case of non-compact materials, one must also take care in determining the mass of the material sample.

If the material is under pressure, the determination of mass from a measured sample weight might need to account for buoyancy effects due to the density of the void constituent, depending on how the measurement was conducted.
