X-ray diffraction is a phenomenon in which the [atoms](https://chemistdictionary.com/atom-2/) of a [crystal](https://chemistdictionary.com/crystal/), by virtue of their uniform spacing, cause an interference pattern of the waves present in an incident beam of X rays. 

The atomic planes of the crystal act on the X rays in exactly the same manner as does a uniformly ruled grating on a beam of [light](https://chemistdictionary.com/light/). 

X-ray diffraction is described by the Bragg's law as,

nλ = 2d sin θ

Where,

nλ refers to the number of wavelength.

θ is the Bragg angle.

_d_ is the distance between atomic, or lattice, planes.

Laue diffraction, in X-rays, is a regular array of spots on a photographic emulsion resulting from X-rays scattered by certain groups of parallel atomic planes within a crystal. 

When a thin, pencil-like beam of X-rays is allowed to impinge on a crystal, certain wavelengths will be oriented at a proper angle to a group of atomic planes.

These beams will combine in phase to produce intense, regularly spaced spots on a film or plate centred around the central image from the beam, which passes through undeviated.
