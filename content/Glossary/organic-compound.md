Organic compounds are generally any [chemical compounds](https://chemistdictionary.com/compound/) that contain carbon-hydrogen bonds. The study of these compounds is known as [Organic chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/compound/).

Although organic compounds make up only a small percentage of the Earth's crust, they are of central importance because all known life is based on organic compounds. 

For historical reasons, a few classes of carbon-containing compounds along with a handful of other exceptions, are not classified as organic compounds and are considered inorganic. 

The few carbon-containing compounds not classified as organic include carbides, carbonates, and cyanides.

### History & Nomenclature

In chemical nomenclature, an _organyl group_, frequently represented by the letter R, refers to any monovalent substituent.

In 1824, when Friedrich Wöhler synthesized oxalic acid, a compound known to occur only in living organisms, from cyanogen, vitalism got reduced.

Vitalism was a widespread conception that substances found in organic nature are created from the chemical elements by the action of a "vital force" or "life-force".

### Classification

Organic compounds may be classified in a variety of ways.

### 1\. Natural compounds

Natural compounds refer to those that are produced by plants or animals.

Many of these are still extracted from natural sources because they would be more expensive to produce artificially.

Examples include most sugars, and some alkaloids and terpenoids.

### 2\. Synthetic compounds

Compounds that are prepared by reaction of other compounds are known as "synthetic".

They may be either compound that already is found in plants or animals or those that do not occur naturally.

One such example of synthetic compounds is polymers.
