Boiling is the rapid [vaporization](https://chemistdictionary.com/vaporization/) of a liquid, which occurs when a liquid is heated to its [boiling point](https://chemistdictionary.com/boiling-point/), and it is considered to be a bulk phenomenon.

The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere.

When a liquid reaches its boiling point, bubbles of gas form in it which gives rise into the surface and burst into the air and at this point boiling occurs.

### Types of boiling

There are two main types of boiling, which are:

### 1\. Nucleate boiling

Nucleate boiling is characterized by the growth of bubbles or pops on a heated surface, which rises from discrete points on a surface.

At these points, the temperature is only slightly above the temperature of the liquid. In general, the number of nucleation sites is increased by increasing surface temperature.

Formation of Critical heat flux boiling is where the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapour forms on the surface. 

### 2\. Transition boiling

Transition boiling may be defined as the unstable boiling, which occurs at surface temperatures between the maximum attainable in nucleate and the minimum attainable in film boiling.

The formation of bubbles in a heated liquid is a complex physical process which often involves cavitation and acoustic effects.

### 3\. Film boiling

If a surface heating the liquid is significantly hotter than the liquid then film boiling will occur, where a thin layer of vapour, which has low thermal conductivity.
