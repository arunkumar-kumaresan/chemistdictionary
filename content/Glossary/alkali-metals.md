Group 1 of the periodic table constitutes alkali metals.

 The alkali metals are so called because reaction with water forms alkalies.

It is otherwise called as s-block elements or representative elements.

This family of elements is also known as the lithium family after its leading element.

### Properties

 Soft and have low densities.

Low melting and boiling points as well as heats of sublimation, vaporisation, and dissociation. 

They all crystallise in the body-centred cubic crystal structure.

### Applications

Lithium is often used in lithium-ion batteries.

Sodium compounds have many applications, the most well-known being sodium chloride as table salt. Sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap.

Potassium compounds are often used as fertilisers.

Rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks.
