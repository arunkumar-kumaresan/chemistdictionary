Hess' law is a relationship in physical chemistry.

It is also known as Hess' law of constant heat summation.

Hess' law is understood as an expression of the principle of conservation of energy, also expressed in the first law of thermodynamics, and even in enthalpy change of a process.

Hess' law can be used to determine the overall energy required for a [chemical reaction](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-reaction/).

### History

 Hess' law is named after Germain Hess, a Switzerland born Russian chemist and physician who published it in 1840.

### Statement

The law states that the total enthalpy change during the complete course of a chemical reaction is the same whether the reaction is made in one step or in several steps.
