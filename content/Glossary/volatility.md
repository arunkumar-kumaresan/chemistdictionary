Volatility is a material quality which describes how readily a substance vaporizes, at a given temperature and pressure.

A substance with high volatility is more likely to exist as a [vapour](https://chemistdictionary.com/vapour/) while a substance with low volatility is more likely to be a liquid or solid. 

Volatility can also describe the tendency of vapour to condense into a liquid or solid; less volatile substances will more readily condense from a vapour than highly volatile ones.

Differences in volatility can be observed by comparing how fast a group of substances evaporate when exposed to the atmosphere. 

Volatility itself has no defined numerical value, but it is often described using [vapour pressures](https://chemistdictionary.com/vapour-pressure/) or [boiling points](https://chemistdictionary.com/boiling-point/) for liquid.

High vapour pressures indicate high volatility, while high boiling points indicate low volatility.

Vapour pressures and boiling points are often presented in tables and charts that can be used to compare chemicals of interest. Volatility data is typically found through experimentation over a range of temperatures and pressures.

An important factor influencing a substance's volatility is the strength of the interactions between its molecules, which is the [intermolecular forces](https://chemistdictionary.com/intermolecular-force/). And hence solids ain't behave volatile.

Volatility tends to decrease with increasing molecular mass, although other factors such as structure and polarity play a significant role.
