Evaporation is a type of [vaporization](https://chemistdictionary.com/vaporization/) that occurs on the surface of a liquid as it changes into the gas phase. The surrounding gas must not be saturated with the evaporating substance.

Evaporation is considered to be a surface phenomenon and when the molecules of the liquid collide, they transfer energy to each other based on how they collide with each other.

When evaporation occurs, the energy removed from the vaporised liquid will reduce the temperature of the liquid, resulting in evaporative cooling.

Evaporation is an [endothermic process](https://chemistdictionary.com/endothermic-process/), in which the heat is absorbed during evaporation and it occurs below the boiling temperature of the substance.

For molecules to evaporate, they must be located near the surface, they have to be moving in the proper direction, and sufficient kinetic energy to overcome liquid-phase [intermolecular](https://chemistdictionary.com/intermolecular-force/) [forces](https://chemistdictionary.com/intermolecular-force/).

Some of the factors influencing evaporation are:

- Concentration of the substance
- Pressure
- Temperature
- Surface area

Evaporation also tends to proceed more quickly with higher flow rates between the gaseous and liquid phase and in liquids with higher vapour pressure.
