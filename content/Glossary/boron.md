## About Boron

Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Classified as a metalloid, it is a solid at room temperature.

## History

It was discovered by Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jaques Thénard, French chemists, and independently by Sir Humphry Davy, an English chemist, in 1808. They all isolated boron by combining boric acid (H3BO3) with potassium.

## Sources

The element is not found free in nature but occurs as orthoboric acid usually found in certain volcanic spring waters and as borates in boron and colemantie.  
Important sources of boron are ore rasorite (kernite) and tincal (borax ore). Both of these ores are found in the Mojave Desert.  
High-purity crystalline boron may be prepared by the vapor phase reduction of boron trichloride or tribromide with hydrogen on electrically heated filaments. The impure or amorphous, boron, a brownish-black powder, can be obtained by heating the trioxide with magnesium powder.

## Isotopes

It exists naturally as 19.78% 10B isotope and 80.22% 11B isotope.  
It has 13 known isotopes. The shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay.

## Uses

- It is used in pyrotechnics and flares to produce a green color.
- It has also been used in some rockets as an ignition source.
- Boron-10, is a good absorber of neutrons and is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors, as a radiation shield and as a neutron detector.
- It's filaments are used in the aerospace industry because of their high-strength and lightweight.
- Boric acid is also an important compound with major markets in textile products. Use of borax as a mild antiseptic is minor in economical terms.
- It's compounds are also extensively used in the manufacture of borosilicate glasses.
- Boron nitride has remarkable properties and can be used to make a material as hard as diamond. The nitride also behaves like an electrical insulator but conducts heat like a metal.
- It also has lubricating properties similar to graphite. The hydrides are easily oxidized with considerable energy liberation, and have been studied for use as rocket fuels.
