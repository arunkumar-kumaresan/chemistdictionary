Covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. It is also known as molecular bond.

These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs.

The stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding.

 In [organic chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/organic-chemistry/), covalent bonds are much more common than ionic bonds.

### History

The term _covalence_ in regard to bonding was first used in 1919 by Irving Langmuir in a _Journal of the American Chemical Society_ 

### Types of covalent bonds

Covalent bonding includes many kinds of interactions.

### 1\.  Sigma bonding

Sigma (σ) bonds are the strongest covalent bonds and are due to head-on overlapping of orbitals on two different atoms. 

### 2\. Pi bonding

 Pi (π) bonds are weaker and are due to lateral overlap between p (or d) orbitals.
