Alcohol is an organic compound that carries at least one hydroxyl functional group (−OH) bound to a saturated [carbon](https://chemistdictionary.com/carbon/) atom.

The term alcohol originally referred to the primary alcohol ethanol (ethyl alcohol), which is used as a drug and is the main alcohol present in alcoholic beverages.

An important class of alcohols, of which methanol and ethanol are the simplest members.

The general formula is CnH2n+1OH.

Simple mono-alcohols include primary (RCH2OH), secondary (R2CHOH) and tertiary (R3COH) alcohols.

### Nomenclature

The suffix _\-ol_ appears in the IUPAC chemical name of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority. 

The word "alcohol" is from the Arabic _kohl_ ( _al-kuḥl_), a powder used as an eyeliner.

The term _ethanol_ was invented in 1892, combining the word ethane with the "-ol" ending of "alcohol".

### Chemical reactions in Alcohols

1. Deprotonation - removal of a proton(H+) from a Brønsted–Lowry acid in an acid-base reaction.
2. Nucleophilic substitution - Class of reactions in which a leaving group(**nucleophile**) is replaced by an electron rich compound
3. Dehydration - Conversion that involves the loss of water from the reacting molecule or ion. 
4. Protonolysis \-  Cleavage of a chemical bond by acids.
5. Esterification -  Occurs when a carboxylic acid **reacts** with an alcohol. 
6. Oxidation - Loss in electrons appears.

### Properties

The hydroxyl group makes alcohols polar.

Owing to the presence of the polar OH alcohols are more water-soluble than simple hydrocarbons.

Methanol, ethanol, and propanol are miscible in water. 

Butanol, with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble.

Hydrogen bonding makes the alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable hydrocarbons and ethers.

The boiling point of the alcohol ethanol is 78.29 °C, compared to 69 °C for the hydrocarbon hexane, and 34.6 °C for diethyl ether.
