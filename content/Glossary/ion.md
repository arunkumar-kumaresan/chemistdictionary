Ion is an atom or [molecule](https://chemistdictionary.com/molecule/) that has a net electrical charge. 

The net charge of an ion is non-zero due to the total number of [electrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron/) being unequal to its total number of protons. 

Ions consisting of only a single atom are termed atomic or monatomic ions.

While two or more atoms that form molecular ions are polyatomic ions.

In the case of physical ionisation in a fluid (gas or liquid), it is termed as ion pairs.

### History

The word _ion_ comes from the Greek origin which means ion as going.

This term was introduced after a suggestion by the English polymath William Whewell.

### Classification of ions

Ions are classified into two types based on the charges, it possess.

- [Anion](https://chemistdictionary.com/cation/) - Atoms or radicals that possess a negative electric charge.
- [Cation](https://chemistdictionary.com/cation/) - Atoms or radicals that possess positive electric charge.
