A microscope is an instrument used to see objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. Microscopy is the science of investigating small objects and structures using such an instrument. 

Microscopic means invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope and enlarges the images of small objects, allowing the observer an exceedingly close view of minute structures.

The magnifying power of a microscope is an expression of the number of times the object being examined appears to be enlarged and is a dimensionless ratio. 

The resolution of a microscope is a measure of the smallest detail of the object that can be observed and it is expressed in linear units, usually micrometres.

### Types of microscopes

### 1\. Optical microscope

The most common type of microscope is the optical microscope. This is an optical instrument containing one or more lenses producing an enlarged image of a sample placed in the focal plane.

Optical microscopes have refractive glass (occasionally plastic or quartz), to focus light on the eye or on to another light detector.

Sarfus is a recent optical technique that increases the sensitivity of a standard optical microscope to a point where it is possible to directly visualize nanometric films and isolated nano-objects.

### 2\. Electron microscope

The German physicist, Ernst Ruska, working with the electrical engineer Max Knoll, developed the first prototype electron microscope in 1931, a transmission electron microscope.

This microscope attains extremely high resolution using an electron beam instead of a beam of light to illuminate the object of study.

The two major types of electron microscopes are:

- Transmission electron microscope (TEM) has magnifying powers of more than 1,000,000×. TEMs form images of thin specimens, typically sections, in a near-vacuum.
- Scanning electron microscope (SEM), creates a reflected image of relief in a contoured specimen, usually has a lower resolution than a TEM.

### 3\. X-ray microscope

X-ray microscopes are instruments that use electromagnetic radiation usually in the soft X-ray band to image objects. They are often used in tomography to produce three-dimensional images of objects.
