Combustion is a [chemical reaction](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-reaction/) between substances, with the help of oxygen accompanied by the generation of [heat](https://chemistdictionary.com/heat/) and [light](https://chemistdictionary.com/light/). It is often hot enough that incandescent light in the form of either glowing or a flame is produced.

Combustion

### History

The term combustion was posited by French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier in 1772.

### Types of combustion

1. **Complete combustion** - the reactant burns in oxygen and produces a limited number of products. The amount of air required for complete combustion to take place is known as pure air.
2. **Incomplete combustion** - It will occur when there is not enough oxygen to allow the fuel to react completely to produce carbon dioxide and water. Carbon monoxide is one of the products of this type of combustion.
3. **Smouldering** - It is a slow, low-temperature, flameless form of combustion, sustained by the heat evolved when oxygen directly attacks the surface of a condensed-phase fuel.
4. **Rapid combustion** -  In this, large amounts of heat and light energy are released, which often results in a flame. This is used in a form of machinery such as internal combustion engines and in thermobaric weapons. Such combustion is frequently called an explosion.
5. **Spontaneous combustion** - This type of combustion occurs by self-heating followed by a thermal run-away. 
6. **Turbulent combustion** \- Combustion resulting in a turbulent flame is the most used for industrial application because the turbulence helps the mixing process between the fuel and oxidizers.
7. **Micro combustion** - Combustion processes which happen in very small volumes.
