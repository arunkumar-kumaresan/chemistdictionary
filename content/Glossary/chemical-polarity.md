In chemistry, polarity is a separation of electric charge leading to a molecule or its chemical groups having an electric dipole moment, with a negatively and positively charged end.

Polar molecules must contain polar bonds due to a difference in [electronegativity](https://chemistdictionary.com/electronegativity/) between the bonded atoms.

Polar molecules interact through dipole–dipole intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonds with a number of physical properties.

The amount of pull, an atom exerts on its electrons is called its electronegativity and those with higher electronegativity exert a greater pull.

### Classification

Bonds can fall between one of two extremes – being completely nonpolar or completely polar. Bond polarity is typically divided into three groups that are based on the difference in electronegativity.

- Non-polar bonds generally occur when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is less than 0.5
- Polar bonds generally occur when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is roughly between 0.5 and 2.0
- Ionic bonds generally occur when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is greater than 2.0
