A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring the electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit.

The typical commercial or laboratory standard voltmeter in use today is likely to employ an electromechanical mechanism.

In-circuit diagrams, a voltmeter is represented by the letter _V_ in a circle, with two emerging lines representing the two points of measurement.

### Voltmeter types

Traditional voltmeters use an electromechanical mechanism, in which the current flowing through turns of wire is translated into a reading of voltage.

### 1\. Analog voltmeter

Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit.

A moving coil galvanometer can be used as a voltmeter by inserting a resistor in series with the instrument. The galvanometer has a coil of fine wire suspended in a strong magnetic field.

When an electric current is applied, the interaction of the magnetic field of the coil and of the stationary magnet creates a torque, tending to make the coil rotate. 

The ratio of torque to the deflection coil is proportional to the direction of current and inversely proportional to voltage, which is indicated by the pointer to measure.

### 2\. Vacuum tube volt meters (VTVMs) and field-effect transistor volt meters (FET-VMs)

Amplified voltmeters often have an input resistance of 1, 10, or 20 megohms which is independent of the range selected. 

A once-popular form of this instrument used a vacuum tube in the amplifier circuit and so was called the vacuum tube voltmeter, or VTVM, were almost always powered by the local AC line current.

Today these circuits use a solid-state amplifier using field-effect transistors, hence FET-VM, and appear in handheld digital multimeters as well as in bench and laboratory instruments. 

Most VTVMs and FET-VMs handle DC voltage, AC voltage, and resistance measurements and modern FET-VMs add current measurements.

### 3\. Digital voltmeter

A digital voltmeter (DVM) measures an unknown input voltage by converting the voltage to a digital value and then displays the voltage in numeric form.

DVMs are usually designed around a special type of analog-to-digital converter called an integrating converter.

The first digital voltmeter was invented and produced by Andrew Kay of Non-Linear Systems (and later founder of Kaypro) in 1954.

Digital voltmeters generally have a higher order of accuracy than analogue instruments.
