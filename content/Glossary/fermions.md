A fermion is a particle that follows Fermi–Dirac statistics in particle physics and generally has half odd integer spin 1/2, 3/2 etc.

Fermi–Dirac statistics describe a distribution of particles over energy states in systems consisting of many identical particles and follow the Pauli exclusion principle.

Fermions include all [quarks](https://chemistdictionary.com/quark/) and leptons, as well as all composite particles made of an odd number of these, such as all [baryons](https://chemistdictionary.com/baryon/) and many atoms and nuclei. 

Fermions are usually associated with matter, and at low temperatures, shows superfluidity for uncharged particles and superconductivity for charged particles.

As a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, only one fermion can occupy a particular quantum state at any given time. 

When multiple fermions have the same spatial probability distribution, then at least one property of each fermion, such as its spin, must be different. 

### Etymology

The name fermion was coined by English theoretical physicist Paul Dirac from the surname of Italian physicist Enrico Fermi.

In July 2015, Weyl fermions have been experimentally realized in Weyl semimetals.

### Fermion classification

### 1\. Elementary fermions

The Standard Model recognizes two types of elementary fermions: quarks and leptons. In all, the model distinguishes 24 different fermions. 

Mathematically, fermions come in three types:

- Weyl fermions: This considered to be a massless fermion
- Dirac fermions: Has a spin 1⁄2 particle which is different from its antiparticle. 
- Majorana fermions: A fermion that is its own antiparticle. 

### 2\. Composite fermions

Composite particles such as [hadrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/hadron/), nuclei, and atoms can be bosons or fermions depending on their constituents.

The quasiparticles of the fractional quantum Hall effect are also known as composite fermions, which are electrons with an even number of quantized vortices(whirlpool) attached to them.
