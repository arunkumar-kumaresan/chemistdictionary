A thermometer is a device that measures [temperature](https://chemistdictionary.com/temperature/) or a temperature gradient, which is the degree of hotness or coldness of an object.

Thermometers are widely used in technology and industry to monitor processes, in meteorology, in medicine, and in scientific research. 

A thermometer has two important elements: a temperature sensor and some means of converting the change in temperature into a numerical value.

Traditional thermometers were all non-registering thermometers, where it doesn't not hold the temperature reading after it was moved to a place with a different temperature. 

Later registering thermometers were designed to hold the temperature indefinitely, so that the thermometer can be removed and read at a later time or in a more convenient place.

Thermometers may be described as empirical or absolute.

- Absolute thermometers are calibrated numerically by the thermodynamic absolute temperature scale.
- Empirical thermometers do not require that the relation between their numerical scale readings be linear, but it does require that relation to be strictly monotonic.

Thermometers can be calibrated either by comparing them with other calibrated thermometers or by checking them against known fixed points on the temperature scale.

The best known of these fixed points are the melting and boiling points of pure water.

### History

The Italian physician Santor Santorio is commonly credited with the invention of the first thermometer, but its standardisation was completed through the 17th and 18th centuries.

The first clear diagram of a thermoscope was published in 1617 by Giuseppe Biancani.

The word comes from the Greek words, thermos, meaning "hot" and metron, meaning "measure".
