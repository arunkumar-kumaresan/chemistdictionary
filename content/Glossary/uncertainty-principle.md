The uncertainty principle is any variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the precision in which the values for certain pairs of physical quantities is predicted from initial conditions.

It actually states the fundamental property of quantum systems and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology.

The uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises as to the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding orthonormal bases in Hilbert space.

This principle is such a basic result in [quantum mechanics](https://chemistdictionary.com/quantum-mechanics/), in which the typical experiments are routinely observed.

The applications of this principle include extremely low-noise technology such as that required in gravitational-wave interferometers.

### History

The German physicist Werner Heisenberg introduced the uncertainty principle, that states that the more precisely the position of some particle.

The formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position _σ__x_ and the standard deviation of momentum _σ__p_ was derived by Earle Hesse Kennard and Hermann Weyl as:

**σx σp ≥ ℏ/2**

Where,

ℏ is the reduced Plank's constant, equal to a value of h/2π.
