The precipitate is solid or curdled stuff that form a solution when the reaction occurs in a liquid solution as a result of precipitation. The word precipitate is from Latin praecipitō which means “throw down, hurl down”.

Without sufficient force of gravity (settling) to bring the solid particles together, the precipitate remains in suspension. Sometimes the formation of a precipitate indicates the occurrence of a chemical reaction. 

The precipitate formation is useful in the detection of the type of [cation](https://chemistdictionary.com/cation/) in a salt. To identify the cation, the colour of the precipitate and its solubility in excess are noted.

Digestion, or precipitate ageing, happens when a freshly formed precipitate is left, usually at a higher temperature, in the solution from which it precipitates.  The Physico-chemical process underlying digestion is called Ostwald ripening.
