A ketone is a functional group with the structure RC(=O)R', where R and R' can be a variety of carbon\-containing substituents. 

Many ketones are of great importance in industry and in biology. Examples include many sugars (ketoses), many steroids and the solvent acetone.

Ketones contain a carbonyl group (a carbon-oxygen double bond). The simplest ketone is acetone (R = R' = methyl), with the formula CH3C(O)CH3. 

Many complex organic compounds are synthesized using ketones as building blocks.

### Nomenclature

The word _ketone_ is derived from _Aketon_, an old German word for 'acetone'. Ketones are named by changing the suffix _\-ane_ of the parent alkane to _\-anone_. 

The derived names of ketones are obtained by writing separately the names of the two alkyl groups attached to the carbonyl group.

### Properties

The ketone carbon is often described as "sp2 hybridised". sp2 hybridisation is the blend of one's atomic orbital and two p atomic orbitals.

Ketones are trigonal planar around the ketonic carbon, with C−C−O and C−C−C bond angles of approximately 120°.

Ketones are nucleophilic at oxygen and electrophilic at carbon. Because the carbonyl group interacts with water by hydrogen bonding.

Ketones are hydrogen-bond acceptors. Because of their inability to serve both as hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, ketones tend not to "self-associate".
