A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a constant volume independent of pressure. It is one of the four fundamental states of matter and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape.

Liquid

It is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. In this state, the atoms are loosely packed in a molecule.

The [density](https://chemistdictionary.com/density/) of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter. 

Liquid particles are bound firmly but not rigidly. They are able to move around one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. 

Liquids may be divided into two general categories: 

- Pure liquids
- Liquid mixtures

As the temperature increases, the increased vibrations of the molecules causes distances between the molecules to increase. 

When a liquid reaches its [boiling point](https://chemistdictionary.com/boiling-point/), the cohesive forces that bind the molecules closely together break, and the liquid changes to its gaseous state.

When the liquid reaches its freezing point the molecules will usually lock into a very specific order, called crystallizing, and the bonds between them become more rigid.
