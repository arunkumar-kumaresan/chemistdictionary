Biochemistry is one of the main branches of Chemistry. It is the study of chemical reactions in living beings, and of biological molecules which is important to cell biology and physiology.

The study of biochemistry involves enzymes, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, sugars, proteins, and lipids. In the body, most of the molecules are polymers built of long chains of smaller molecules.

It studies the chemical transformations which produce these small building-block molecules, and which produce energy from food.

### History

The term biochemistry itself is derived from the combining form _bio__\-_, meaning life, and chemistry. The word is first recorded in English in 1848.
