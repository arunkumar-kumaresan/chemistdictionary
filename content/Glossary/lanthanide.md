Lanthanum

Lanthanide or lanthanoid is a series of chemical elements comprises the 15  metallic chemical elements with [atomic numbers](https://chemistdictionary.com/atomic-number/) 57–71, from lanthanum through the lutetium.

The informal chemical symbol **Ln** is used in general discussions of lanthanide chemistry to refer to any lanthanide. 

Their atoms have similar configurations and similar physical and chemical behaviour; the most common valences are 3 and 4. 

These elements, along with the chemically similar elements scandium and yttrium, are often collectively known as the rare earth elements.

### Elements in Lanthanide series

### History

- Lanthanides are called so, because of the elements in the series are chemically similar to lanthanum.
- Lanthanum itself is named after a word for hidden since these elements are hard to find.

### Applications

- These elements are used in include superconductors.
- Lanthanide ions are used as the active ions in luminescent materials used in optoelectronics applications.
- Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres can act as tunable microwave resonators.
- The complex Gadolinium(DOTA) is used in magnetic resonance imaging(MRI).
