An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. Hydrophilic (water- loving) components dissolve in aqueous solution

Aqueous solutions that conduct electric current are strong electrolytes. Acids and bases are said to be aqueous solutions.

A _non-aqueous solution_ is a solution in which the solvent is a liquid, but is not water.

 It is depicted in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant [chemical formula](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-formula/).

The ability of a substance to dissolve in water is determined by whether the substance can match or exceed the strong attractive forces that water molecules generate between themselves.

If the substance lacks the ability to dissolve in water, the molecules form a precipitate.

### Reaction in aqueous solutions

Reactions in aqueous solutions are usually metathesis reactions. Metathesis reactions are otherwise called as double-displacement.

In this, cation displaces to form an ionic bond with the other anion.

The cation bonded with the latter anion will dissociate and bond with the other anion.
