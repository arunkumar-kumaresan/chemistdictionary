**Glass** is a non-crystalline, often a transparent amorphous solid.

Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form, basically from silica sand.

One of the naturally available glasses is volcanic glass.

It is hard, brittle, and impervious to the natural elements.

They pass through a viscous stage in cooling from a state of fluidity.

Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass. 

### History

Archaeological evidence suggests glass-making dates back to at least 3,600 BC in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Syria. 

The earliest known glass objects were beads.

### Properties

- Glass has been used in optical systems due to its ability to refract, reflect.
- Glass is typically inert, resistant to chemical attack.
- The density of glass is about 2.2 grams per cubic centimetre.
- It has a tensile strength of about 14-35 giga Pascals.
