Levelling effect is the effect of solvent on the properties of acids and bases.

It is also said to be solvent effect in which the strength of a strong acid is limited ("leveled") by the basicity of the solvent

The strength of a strong base is leveled by the acidity of the solvent.

Strong bases are _leveling solvents_ for acids, weak bases are _differentiating solvents_ for acids.

In a leveling solvent, many acids are completely dissociated and thus have the same strength. Hence all acids tend to become indistinguishable in strength when dissolved.

In a differentiating solvent on the other hand, various acids dissociate to different degrees and thus have different strengths. 

Because of the leveling effect of common solvents, studies on super acids are conducted in more differentiating solvents that are very weakly basic.

### Types of solvents

Here, the solvent types are based on the proton interaction.

- Protophilic solvents: Solvents which have greater tendency to accept protons, i.e., water, alcohol,etc.
- Protogenic solvents: Solvents which have the tendency to produce protons, i.e., water, liquid hydrogen, etc.
- Amphiprotic solvents: Solvents which act both as protophilic or protogenic, e.g., water, ammonia, ethyl alcohol, etc.
-  Aprotic solvents: Solvents which neither donate nor accept protons, e.g., benzene, carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulphide, etc.
