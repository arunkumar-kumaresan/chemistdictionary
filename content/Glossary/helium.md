## About Helium

Helium, the second most abundant element in the observable universe. It was discovered on the sun before it was found on the earth. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.

## History

From the Greek word _helios_, the sun. Janssen obtained the first evidence of helium during the solar eclipse of 1868 when he detected a new line in the solar spectrum. Lockyer and Frankland suggested the name helium for the new element. In 1895 Ramsay discovered helium in the uranium mineral cleveite while it was independently discovered in cleveite by the Swedish chemist's Cleve and Langlet at about the same time. Rutherford and Royds in 1907 demonstrated that alpha particles are helium nuclei.

## Sources

Except for hydrogen, helium is the most abundant element found in the universe. Helium is extracted from natural gas. In fact, all-natural gas contains at least trace quantities of helium.  
It has been detected spectroscopically in great abundance, especially in the hotter stars, and it is an important component in both the proton-proton reaction and the carbon cycle, which account for the energy of the sun and stars.

## Compounds

Helium is an inert gas and does not easily combine with other elements. There are no known compounds that contain helium, although attempts are being made to produce helium diflouride (HeF2).

## Isotopes

There are nine known isotopes of helium, but only helium-3 and helium-4 are stable. In the Earth's atmosphere, one atom is 3He for every million that are 4He.  
The most common isotope, helium-4, is produced on Earth by alpha decay of heavier radioactive elements.  
Helium-3 is present on Earth only in trace amounts. Most of it has been present since Earth's formation, though some fall to Earth trapped in cosmic dust.

## Uses

- Helium is extensively used for filling balloons as it is a much safer gas than hydrogen.
- Liquid helium's use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to increase as the medical profession accepts and develops new uses for the equipment.
- It is used as a cooling medium for nuclear reactors
- It is used as an inert shield for arc welding, to pressurize the fuel tanks of liquid fueled rockets and in supersonic windtunnels.
- Helium is combined with oxygen to create a nitrogen free atmosphere for deep sea divers so that they will not suffer from a condition known as nitrogen narcosis.
- Liquid helium is an important cryogenic material and is used to study superconductivity and to create superconductive magnets.
