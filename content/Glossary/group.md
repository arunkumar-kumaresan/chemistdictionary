A group is a column of elements in the [periodic table](https://chemistdictionary.com/periodic-table/) of the chemical [elements](https://chemistdictionary.com/element/). It is also referred to as a family. The elements in a group have similar physical or chemical characteristics of the outermost electron shells of their [atoms](https://chemistdictionary.com/atom-2/).

The modern numbering system of "group 1" to "group 18" has been recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) since about 1990.

### Classification of group

There are 18 numbered groups in a periodic table, out of those between 3 and 4 group is not numbered, which is said to be f-block elements.

Table of periodic table group number and family name
