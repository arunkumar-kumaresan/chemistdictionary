An organic base is an organic compound which acts as a [base](https://chemistdictionary.com/base/) and usually acts as proton acceptors.

They usually contain nitrogen atoms, which can easily be protonated. This includes amines or nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds.

Electronegative atoms or species (such as fluorine or the nitro group) will have an "electron-withdrawal" effect and thereby reduce the basicity. 

Hydroxide donors rather than proton acceptors are not always stable.

Some of the organic bases include:

- Pyridine: A basic heterocyclic organic compound structurally related to benzene.
- Alkanamines: A colourless gas which is a derivative of ammonia, but with one [hydrogen](https://chemistdictionary.com/hydrogen/) atom being replaced by a methyl group.
- Imidazole: It is a white or colourless solid that is soluble in water, producing a mildly alkaline solution.
- Benzimidazole: It is a colourless solid, a bicyclic compound consists of the fusion of benzene and imidazole.
- Histidine: An α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.
- Guanidine: It is a strong, colourless solid that dissolves in polar solvents.
- Phosphazene bases: They are strong non-metallic non-ionic and low-nucleophilic bases. They are stronger bases.
