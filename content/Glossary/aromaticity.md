Aromaticity is a property of cyclic (ring-shaped), planar (flat) structures with a ring of resonance bonds that gives increased stability compared to other geometric or connective arrangements with the same set of atoms.

Aromatic molecules are very stable, and do not break apart easily to react with other substances. 

The most common aromatic compounds are derivatives of benzene.

Aromaticity is a chemical property that bears no general relationship with the olfactory properties of such compounds before the structure of benzene or organic compounds was understood.

### History

The earliest use of the term _aromatic_ was in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855.

Hofmann used the term for a class of benzene compounds, many of which have odors (aromas), unlike pure saturated hydrocarbons.

### Characteristics of aromatic compounds

- A delocalized conjugated π system, most commonly an arrangement of alternating single and double bonds.
- Coplanar structure, with all the contributing atoms in the same plane.
- Contributing atoms arranged in one or more rings.
- Hückel's rule - A number of π delocalized electrons that is even, but not a multiple of 4. That is, 4_n_ + 2 π-electrons, where _n_ = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on.
