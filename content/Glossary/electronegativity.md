Electronegativity is the ability of an [atom](https://chemistdictionary.com/atom-2/) to attract towards itself an [electron](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron/) pair shared with another atom in a chemical [bond](https://chemistdictionary.com/bond/).

An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its [atomic number](https://chemistdictionary.com/atomic-number/) and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus.

### History

The term "electronegativity" was introduced by Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1811, though the concept was known even before that and was studied by many chemists including Avogadro.

### Methods of calculation

As only differences in electronegativity are defined, it is necessary to choose an arbitrary reference point in order to construct a scale.

### 1\. Pauling Scale

Pauling first proposed the concept of electronegativity in 1932.

It is calculated by the covalent bond between two different atoms (A–B) is stronger than would be expected by taking the average of the strengths of the A–A and B–B bonds.

Bonds are expressed in electron-volts.

According to valence bond theory, of which Pauling was a notable proponent, this "additional stabilization" of the heteronuclear bond is due to the contribution of ionic canonical forms to the bonding.

### 2\. Mulliken electronegativity

Robert S. Mulliken proposed that the arithmetic mean of the first ionization energy and the electron affinity should be a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons.

 It has also been termed absolute electronegativity.

It is expressed in units of kilojoules per mole or electron-volts.

### 3\. Allred–Rochow electronegativity

A. Louis Allred and Eugene G. Rochow considered that electronegativity should be related to the charge experienced by an electron on the surface of an atom.

The higher the charge per unit area of atomic surface the greater the tendency of that atom to attract electrons.

It is represented in picometres.

### 4\. Sanderson electronegativity equalization

R.T. Sanderson has also noted the relationship between Mulliken electronegativity and atomic size and has proposed a method of calculation based on the reciprocal of the atomic volume.

Electronegativity equalization suggests that the electrons distribute themselves around a molecule to minimize or to equalize the Mulliken electronegativity.

This behaviour is analogous to the equalization of chemical potential in macroscopic thermodynamics.

### 5\. Allen electronegativity

Leland C. Allen, who has proposed that it is related to the average energy of the valence electrons in a free atom.

It is usual to apply a scaling factor, 1.75×10−3 for energies expressed in kilojoules per mole or 0.169 for energies measured in electron-volts, to give values that are numerically similar to Pauling electronegativities.
