Hydrate is a substance that contains water or its constituent elements.

In [organic chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/organic-chemistry/), a hydrate is a compound formed by the hydration.

The best-known hydrates are crystalline solids that lose their fundamental structures upon removal of the bound water.

Many manufacturing processes provide an opportunity for hydrates to form.

The state of hydration can be changed with environmental humidity and time. 

Substances that spontaneously absorb water from the air to form hydrates are known as hygroscopic or deliquescent.

If the water is heavy water, where the hydrogen involved is the isotope deuterium, then the term deuterate may be used in place of the hydrate.

### **Clathrate hydrates**

These hydrates are water ice with gas molecules trapped in the form of clathrate.

An important example is methane hydrate.

Non-polar molecules constitute clathrate hydrates.

### Stabilty of hydrates

The stability of hydrates is generally determined by,

- Nature of the compounds
- Temperature
- Relative humidity
