The Tyndall effect also known as Willis–Tyndall scattering is [light](https://chemistdictionary.com/light/) scattering by particles in a colloid or in a very fine suspension.

Tyndall effect is named after the 19th-century physicist John Tyndall, who discovered this effect.

It is similar to Rayleigh scattering, in that the intensity of the scattered light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength.

Under the Tyndall effect, the longer wavelengths are more transmitted while the shorter wavelengths are more diffusely reflected via scattering. 

This effect is seen in a light-transmitting medium when the diameter of an individual particle is the range of roughly between 40 and 900 nm.
