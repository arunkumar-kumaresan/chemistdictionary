## About Beryllium

Beryllium is a chemical element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. Classified as an alkaline earth metal, beryllium is a solid at room temperature.

## History

The name derives from the Greek word _beryllos_ for "beryl", a gemstone in which it is found (3BeO×Al2O3×6SiO2).  
Beryllium was discovered by the French chemist and pharmacist Nicholas-Louis Vauquelin in beryl and emerald in 1797. The element was first separated in 1828 by the French chemist Antoine-Alexandre-Brutus Bussy and independently by the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler. Because the salts of beryllium have a sweet taste, the element was also known as glucinium from the Greek _glykys_ for "sweet", until IUPAC selected the name beryllium in 1949.

## Sources

Beryllium is found in some 30 mineral species, the most important of which are bertrandite, beryl, chrysoberyl, and phenacite. Aquamarine and emerald are precious forms of beryl. Beryl and bertrandite are the most important commercial sources of the element and its compounds. Most of the metal is now prepared by reducing beryllium fluoride with magnesium metal. Beryllium metal did not become readily available to industry until 1957.

## Isotopes

Both stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust. Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic and mononuclidic element.

## Uses

- Beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and is used to make windows for X-ray tubes.
- When exposed to alpha particles, such as those emitted by radium or polonium, beryllium emits neutrons and is used as a neutron source. Beryllium is also used as a moderator in nuclear reactors.
- Beryllium is alloyed with copper (2% beryllium, 98% copper) to form a wear resistant material, known as beryllium bronze, used in gyroscopes and other devices where wear resistance is important.
- Beryllium is alloyed with nickel (2% beryllium, 98% nickel) to make springs, spot-welding electrodes and non-sparking tools.
- Other beryllium alloys are used in the windshield, brake disks and other structural components of the space shuttle.
- It is used in gyroscopes, computer parts, and instruments where lightness, stiffness, and dimensional stability are required. The oxide has a very high melting point and is also used in nuclear work and ceramic applications.
