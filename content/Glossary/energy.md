Energy of any chemical compounds is stored in the bonds.

Energy is often represented in terms joules(J), electron-volt(eV), etc.

It may be released during a chemical reaction in the form of heat, such reactions are called exothermic. 

An **exothermic reaction** is a chemical **reaction** that releases energy through light or heat. 

In dimension analysis, the dimension of energy is given as **M** **L**2 **T**−2 .

According to the Law of conservation of energy, energy can neither be created nor destroyed.

Thus, the energy is conserved.

### Types of energy

1. Chemical Energy - Potential of a chemical substance to undergo a chemical reaction to transform into other substances. 
2. Ionisation Energy -  It is the minimum amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron, the valence electron, of an isolated neutral gaseous atom or molecule.
3. Nuclear Binding Energy - The minimum energy that would be required to disassemble the nucleus of an atom into its component parts. 
4. Thermal Energy \- Kinetic energy of the microscopic motion of particles.
5. Rest Energy - Energy of a particle at rest, which is equivalent to its mass.

### Conversion of energy

The chemical energy in coal is converted into electrical energy at a power plant.

In a battery, it supplies electrical power by means of electrolysis.
