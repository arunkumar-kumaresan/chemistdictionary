Isomers are molecules or polyatomic ions with identical chemical formulae but distinct arrangements of atoms in space.

Isomers do not necessarily share similar properties. Many isomers are equal or roughly equal in bond energy. The process exhibited by isomers is called as isomerization.

### Etymology

Isomer is from Greek origin isomerès, which means _isos_ = equal and méros = part.

The term was coined by Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1830.

### Types of isomers

There are two general types of isomers. 

### 1\. Constitutional isomers

Isomers that differ in connectivity and sometimes in structural identity.

### 2\. Stereo-isomers

Isomers that have the same composition but that differ in the orientation of those parts in space. 

There are two kinds of stereo-isomers:

- Enantiomers - Isomers with mirror image or identical isomers.
- Diastereomers - Isomers with non-mirror image or non-identical stereoisomers.
