Schrodinger equation is a linear partial differential equation describes the wave function or state function of a quantum-mechanical system.

Using the postulates of [quantum mechanics](https://chemistdictionary.com/quantum-mechanics/), this equation can be derived from the fact that the time-evolution operator must be unitary, and generated by the exponential of a self-adjoint operator.

The self-adjoint operator is said to be quantum Hamiltonian which is named after is named after William Rowan Hamilton.

The Schrodinger equation is not the only way to study quantum mechanical systems and make predictions but, there are numerous way to determine wave functions.

The most general form is the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE), which gives a description of a system evolving with time.

The time-dependent Schrodinger equation describes that the wave functions can form standing waves, called stationary states.

Stationary states can also be described by a simpler form of the Schrodinger equation known as the time-independent Schrodinger equation (TISE).

The Schrodinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time.
