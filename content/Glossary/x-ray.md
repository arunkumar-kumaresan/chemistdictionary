An X-ray, or X-radiation, is a penetrating form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 10 picometres to 10 nanometres.

X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays.

Whenever charged particles such as [electrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/electron/) or [ions](https://chemistdictionary.com/ion/) of sufficient energy hit a material, X-rays are produced.

X-rays can be generated by an X-ray tube, a vacuum tube that uses a high voltage to accelerate the electrons released by a hot [cathode](https://chemistdictionary.com/cathode/) to a high velocity.

These high-velocity electrons collide with a [metal](https://chemistdictionary.com/metal/) target, the [anode](https://chemistdictionary.com/anode/), creating the X-rays.

X-rays with high photon energies (above 5–10 keV, below 0.2–0.1 nm wavelength) are called hard X-rays, while those with lower energy (and longer wavelength) are called soft X-rays.

X-ray [photons](https://chemistdictionary.com/photon/) carry enough energy to ionize atoms and disrupt molecular bonds. This makes it a type of ionizing radiation, and therefore harmful to living tissue.

Hard X-rays can traverse relatively thick objects without being much absorbed or scattered. For this reason, X-rays are widely used to image the inside of visually opaque objects.

X-rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible [light](https://chemistdictionary.com/light/), which makes it possible to probe structures much smaller than can be seen using a normal microscope. 

### History

In many languages, X-radiation is referred to as Röntgen radiation, after the German scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who discovered it on November 8, 1895. He named it X-radiation to signify an unknown type of radiation.

Before their discovery in 1895, X-rays were just a type of unidentified radiation emanating from experimental discharge tubes.
