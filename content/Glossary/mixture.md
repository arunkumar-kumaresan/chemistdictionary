A mixture is the physical combination of two or more substances in which the identities are retained and mixed.

Mixtures are one product of mechanically blending or mixing chemical substances such as elements and compounds, without chemical bonding or other chemical change

Mixtures can be in the form of solutions, colloids or suspension. These mixtures are classified into two main categories as homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures.

A mixture in which its constituents are distributed uniformly is called a homogeneous mixture. It has both a solute and solvent present and is also called a solution.

A mixture in which its constituents are not distributed uniformly is called heterogeneous mixture and this is also called a suspension.

A colloid is a mixture in which one substance of microscopically dispersed insoluble or soluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. 

The substances in a mixture can be separated using physical methods such as filtration, [freezing](https://chemistdictionary.com/freezing/), and [distillation](https://chemistdictionary.com/distillation/). Mixtures have variable compositions, while compounds have a fixed, definite formula.

### Mixtures in states of matter

The mixtures undergo two phases namely dispersion medium and dispersion phase.

The state in which a dispersed phase is yet to be mixed is known as the dispersion medium.
