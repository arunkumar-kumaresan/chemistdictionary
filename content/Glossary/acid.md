## Definition

An acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a [proton](https://chemistdictionary.com/proton/) (hydrogen ion H+) or, alternatively, capable of forming a [covalent bond](https://chemistdictionary.com/covalent-bond/) with an electron pair. Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions or can be dissolved in water

The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/acēre, meaning 'sour'.

## Classification of Acids

Acids are classified into various types based on the various criteria.

- Based on the concentration
- Based on the strength
- Based on basicity
- Based on composition

### Based on the concentration

The concentration of an acid is determined by the amount of acid dissolved in water.

- **Concentrated Acid** - High concentration of H+ ions(Pure form)
- **Diluted Acid** - Lower concentration of H+ ions(concentration of water less than the concentration of acid)

### Based on the strength

Strength of acid is given the amount of hydronium ions in one mole of an acid in water.

- **Strong Acid** \- Dissociates almost completely into its ions in their aqueous solution.
- **Weak Acid -** Dissociates partially into its ions in their aqueous solution.

### Based on basicity

It is the number of hydroxyl ions with which one molecule of acid can combine in aqueous solution.

- **Monobasic Acid** - Acids whose one molecule replaces one hydroxyl ion.
- **Dibasic Acid** - Acids whose one molecule replaces two hydroxyl ions. 
- **Tribasic Acid** - Acids whose one molecule replaces three hydroxyl ions.

### Based on composition

- **Oxyacids** \- Acids that contain Oxygen.
- **Hydro-acids** - Acids that contain hydrogen and other electronegative elements(except oxygen).

### Based on origin

- Organic Acid - Acids that occur naturally.
- Inorganic Acid - Acids that are extracted from the minerals/ inorganic compounds.
