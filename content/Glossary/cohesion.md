Cohesion is the intermolecular attractive force acting between two adjacent portions of a substance, particularly of a solid or liquid. 

It is the action or property of like molecules sticking together, being mutually attractive.

It is an intrinsic property of a substance that is caused by the shape and structure of its molecules.

Cohesion, along with adhesion (attraction between unlike molecules), helps to explain phenomena such as meniscus, surface tension and capillary action.

The potential energy between molecules is at a minimum, and requires the expenditure of work to either approximate or separate them.
