Induced radioactivity is the process of using radiation to make a previously stable material radioactive.

It is also known as artificial radioactivity or man-made radioactivity.

Neutron activation is the main form of induced radioactivity.

Neutrons that have been slowed through a neutron moderator (thermal neutrons) are more likely to be captured by nuclei than fast neutrons.

A less common form of induced radioactivity results from removing a neutron by photo-disintegration.

### History

The husband and wife team of Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot-Curie discovered induced radioactivity in 1934.

They shared the 1935 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this discovery.

Irene branched off from the Curies to study turning stable isotopes into radioactive isotopes by bombarding the stable material with alpha particles.
