Molecular formulae indicate the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule of a molecular substance. 

This indicates the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule, with no information on the structure. For example, the molecular formula of glucose is given as **C₆H₁₂O₆**.

A molecular formula shows the number of elements in a molecule and determines whether it is a binary compound, ternary compound, quaternary compound, or has even more elements.

They are the same as empirical formulae for molecules that only have one atom of a particular type but otherwise may have larger numbers. 

A molecular formula provides more information about a molecule than its empirical formula but is more difficult to establish.

The molecular formula can be determined using the empirical formula and the molecular weight of a chemical component.
