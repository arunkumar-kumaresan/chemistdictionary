The Kelvin is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI), having the unit symbol K.

 It is named after the Belfast-born, Glasgow University engineer and physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin. The Kelvin is now defined by fixing the numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to 1.380 649×10−23 J K−1.

The Kelvin is the primary unit of temperature measurement in the physical sciences but is often used in conjunction with the degree Celsius, which has the same magnitude.

This unit was originally defined as 100/27, 316 of the triple point, which is the equilibrium among the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of pure water. 

The Kelvin is often used as a measure of the colour temperature of light sources. Colour temperature is based upon the principle that black body radiation emits light with a frequency distribution.

In electronics, the Kelvin is used as an indicator of how noisy a circuit is in relation to an ultimate noise floor, i.e. the noise temperature.
