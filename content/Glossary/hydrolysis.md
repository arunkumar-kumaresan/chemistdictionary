Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction in which a molecule of water ruptures one or more chemical bonds. 

The term is used broadly for substitution,  elimination, and solvation reactions in which water is the nucleophile.

It is a double decomposition reaction.

The reactants other than water, and the products of hydrolysis, may be neutral molecules.

The hydrolysis involves several steps, of which the slowest is the formation of a [covalent bond](https://chemistdictionary.com/covalent-bond/) between the oxygen atom of the water molecule and other molecules it reacts with.

### Etymology

The term hydrolysis is from Ancient Greek, which depicts, hydro\-water and lysis\-to bind.
