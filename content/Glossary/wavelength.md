Wavelength is the distance between two points or particles in the same phase. In other words, it is the spatial period of a periodic wave, the distance over which the wave's shape repeats.

Wavelength is commonly designated by the Greek letter lambda (λ). The term wavelength is also sometimes applied to modulated waves, and to the sinusoidal envelopes of modulated waves.

The range of wavelengths or frequencies for wave phenomena is called a spectrum. The name originated with the visible light spectrum but now can be applied to the entire [electromagnetic spectrum](https://chemistdictionary.com/electromagnetic-spectrum/).

Wavelength is equal to the speed (v) of a wave train in a medium divided by its frequency (_f_), which is given by,

λ = v/_f_.

A quantity related to the wavelength is the angular wavelength also known as reduced wavelength, usually symbolized by _ƛ_ and is equal to,

ƛ = λ/2.

The term sub-wavelength is used to describe an object having one or more dimensions smaller than the length of the wave with which the object interacts.
