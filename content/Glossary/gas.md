Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter. A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms.

### History

The word _gas_ was first used by the early 17th-century Flemish chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont.

He identified carbon dioxide, the first known gas other than air.

### Characteristics of Gas

- Arrangement of atoms - Loosely packed.
- Van der Waals force of attraction - Otherwise known as intermolecular forces. Since the [atoms](https://chemistdictionary.com/atom-2/) are loosely packed, the force of attraction is also less.
- Macroscopic - It is typical to specify a frame of reference or length scale. A larger length scale corresponds to a macroscopic or global point of view of the gas.
- Pressure \- It is the sum of all the normal components of force exerted by the particles impacting the walls of the container divided by the surface area of the wall. The pressure is measured in terms of pascals.
- Temperature - The speed of a gas particle is proportional to its absolute temperature. It is represented in kelvins.
- Density - Since gas molecules can move freely within a container, their mass is normally characterized by [density](https://chemistdictionary.com/density/). Density is the amount of mass per unit volume of a substance or the inverse of specific volume.
