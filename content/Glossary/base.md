Bases are the chemical component that releases hydroxide ions(OH-). Most of the bases are minerals.

It includes hydroxides, oxides and carbonates of a metal.

### Classification of Bases

Bases are classified into various types of based on the following characteristics:

#### 1\. On the basis of strength

Strength of a base is determined by the number of hydroxide ions present in the aqueous solution. 

- Strong base - Bases that ionise completely in the aqueous solution. 
- Weak base - Bases that partially ionizes in the aqueous solution.

#### 2\. Based on the acidity of bases

The acidity of a base is defined as the number of hydroxyl ions replaced by one molecule of the base in aqueous solution.

- **Monoacidic Base** \- Base that ionises to give one hydroxide ion per molecule in aqueous solution.
- **Diacidic Base** \- Base that ionises to give two hydroxide ions per molecule in aqueous solution. 
- **Triacidic Base** - Base that ionises to give three hydroxide ions per molecule in aqueous solution.
