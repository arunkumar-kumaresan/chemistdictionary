Vapour pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by a vapour in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases (solid or liquid) at a given temperature in a closed system. 

 It relates to the tendency of particles to escape from the liquid (or a solid). The pressure exhibited by vapour present above a liquid surface is known as vapour pressure. 

A substance with a high vapour pressure at normal temperatures is often referred to as volatile, a tendency to vaporize.

The vapour pressure of any substance increases non-linearly with temperature according to the Clausius–Clapeyron relation, which shows a discontinuous phase transition between two phases of matter.

The vapour pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called partial pressure. 

Vapour pressure is measured in the standard units of pressure. The International System of Units (SI) recognises pressure as a derived unit.

The pascal (Pa) is a standard unit of vapour pressure and one pascal is equal to one newton per square meter (N·m−2 or kg·m−1·s−2).

Very low vapour pressures of solids can be measured using the Knudsen effusion cell method, an effusion evaporator.

The Duhring's rule states that a linear relationship exists between the temperatures at which two solutions exert the same vapour pressure.
