Faraday's laws of electrolysis are quantitative relationships based on electrochemical research.

The laws were first described by the English scientist Michael Faraday in 1833.

### Faraday's first law of electrolysis

The mass of the substance (m) deposited or liberated at an electrode is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity or charge (Q) passed.

In equation, m= e.Q

Where, e is the electrochemical equivalent.

### Faraday's second law of electrolysis

This law states that the amounts of chemical changes produced by the same quantity of electricity in different substances are proportional to their equivalent weights.

This can be represented as, m∝E

Where,

m is the mass of the substance.

E is the electrochemical equivalent.
