Spectrochemistry deals with the methods of chemical analysis that depend upon the measurement of the wavelength and the intensity of electromagnetic radiation. 

It includes the analysis of spectra qualitatively and quantitatively by their presence in samples.

Its major use is in the determination of the arrangement of atoms and electrons in molecules of [chemical](https://chemistdictionary.com/compound/) [compounds](https://chemistdictionary.com/compound/) on the basis of the amounts of energy.

This absorbed energy varies during the change in structure or motion of the molecules.

Quantitative analysis by emission spectroscopy depends upon the fact that the quantity of light emitted at a given wavelength is proportional to the number of atoms vaporized and excited. 

Among various methods only two methods usually are implied for the analysis:

- Ultraviolet (nonvisible) and visible emission spectroscopy.
- Ultraviolet, visible, and infrared absorption spectrophotometry.

In emission spectroscopy, atoms are excited to energy levels higher than their lowest normal levels (ground states) by means of electrical discharges or flames.
