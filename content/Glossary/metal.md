A metal is a material that, when freshly prepared, polished, or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, which conducts electricity and heat.

Metal

It is generally regarded as any substance capable of conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute zero. It may be a chemical element, or an [alloy](https://chemistdictionary.com/alloy/) or a molecular compound.

### Etymology

The word metal is from the Greek word métallon, which means "mine, quarry, metal".

### Types of metal

It can be categorised according to their physical or chemical properties.

#### 1\. Ferrous and non-ferrous metals

Ferrous metals are often magnetic, but not exclusively. Non-ferrous metals are alloy that is insufficient of appreciable amounts of iron.

#### 2\. Brittle metal

Low values of the ratio of bulk elastic modulus to shear modulus (Pugh's criterion) are indicative of intrinsic brittleness.

#### 3\. Refractory metal

It has extraordinarily resistant to heat and wear. They all have melting points above 2000 °C, and a high hardness at room temperature.

#### 4\. White metal

It is a range of white-coloured metals with relatively low melting points.  Such metals include zinc, cadmium, tin, antimony, lead, and bismuth, some of which are quite toxic.

#### 5\. Heavy and light metals

It is any relatively dense metal or metalloid. Some heavy metals have niche uses, or are notably toxic; some are essential in trace amounts. All other metals are light metals.

### Properties

- It is typically malleable and ductile, deforming under stress without cleaving.
- Heat or forces larger than a metal's elastic limit may cause a permanent deformation, known as plastic deformation or plasticity.
- It is usually inclined to form cation through electron loss. Most of those react with oxygen in the air to form oxides.
