## About Hydrogen

Composed of a single proton and a single electron, hydrogen is the simplest and most abundant element in the universe. It is estimated that 90% of the visible universe is composed of hydrogen.

## History

The name derives from the Greek _hydro_ for "water" and _genes_ for "forming" because it burned in air to form water. Hydrogen was discovered by the English physicist Henry Cavendish in 1766.

## Sources

Hydrogen is estimated to make up more than 90% of all the atoms -- three-quarters of the mass of the universe! This element is found in the stars and plays an important part in powering the universe through both the proton-proton reaction and carbon-nitrogen cycle. Stellar hydrogen fusion processes release massive amounts of energy by combining hydrogens to form helium.

## Compounds

Hydrogen combines with other elements to form numerous compounds. Some of the common ones are: water (H2O), ammonia (NH3), methane (CH4), table sugar (C12H22O11), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).

## Isotopes

Hydrogen has three common isotopes. The simplest isotope, called protium, is just ordinary hydrogen. The second, a stable isotope called deuterium, was discovered in 1932. The third isotope, tritium, was discovered in 1934.

## Uses

- Large amounts of hydrogen are combined with nitrogen from the air to produce ammonia (NH3) through a process called the Haber process.
- Hydrogen is also added to fats and oils, such as peanut oil, through a process called hydrogenation.
- Liquid hydrogen is used in the study of superconductors and, when combined with liquid oxygen, makes an excellent rocket fuel.
- The hydrogen fuel cell is a developing technology that will allow great amounts of electrical power to be obtained using a source of hydrogen gas.
- It is also used in large quantities in methanol production, in hydrodealkylation, hydrocracking, and hydrodesulfurization.
- Other uses include welding, producing hydrochloric acid, reducing metallic ores, and filling balloons.
