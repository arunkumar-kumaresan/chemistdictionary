The rate law or rate equation for a chemical reaction is an equation that links the initial or forward reaction rate with the characteristics of the reactants.

The rate law of a reaction with an assumed multi-step mechanism can often be derived theoretically using quasi-steady-state assumptions from the underlying elementary reactions.

When the experimental rate equation has been determined, it is often of use for deduction of the reaction mechanism.

An undefined reaction order occurs when the rate of the reactant is not proportional to some power of the concentration of that reactant.

### Representation of rate equations

Rate equation can be depicted in many ways. But the preference always goes with the simplest ones.

### 1\. Power law

A common form for the rate equation is a power law. Here,

**V0 = k \[A\]^x \[B\]^y...**

Where,

k is the constant of rate equation

x,y is the exponents, which can be fractional, are called partial orders of reaction and their sum is the overall order of reaction.

### 2\. Integral method

The tentative rate equation determined by the method of initial rates is normally verified by comparing the concentrations measured over a longer time.

The integrated rate law for a first-order reaction is,

**ln\[A\] = -kt + ln\[A\]0**

where, \[A\]0 is the initial concentration.
