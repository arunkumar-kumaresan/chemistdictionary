Wet chemistry is a form of [analytical chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/analytical-chemistry/) that uses classical methods such as observation to analyze materials, mostly in the [liquid](https://chemistdictionary.com/liquid/) phase.

Wet chemistry is also called bench chemistry since many tests are performed at lab benches and use laboratory glassware to prevent materials from being contaminated. 

### History

Before the age of theoretical and computational chemistry, wet chemistry was the predominant form of scientific discovery in the chemical field. 

For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as classic chemistry or classical chemistry. 

Because of the high volume of wet chemistry that must be done in today's society and new quality control requirements, many wet chemistry methods have been automated.

### Methods involved in wet chemistry

### 1\. Qualitative Methods

Qualitative methods use changes in information that cannot be quantified to detect a change. This can include a change in colour, smell, texture, etc.

### 2\. Quantitative Methods

Quantitative methods use information that can be measured and quantified to indicate a change. This can include changes in [volume](https://chemistdictionary.com/volume/), [concentration](https://chemistdictionary.com/concentration/), weight, etc.
