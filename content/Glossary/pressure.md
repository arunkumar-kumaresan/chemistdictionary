The pressure is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed.

The SI unit of pressure is the [pascal](https://chemistdictionary.com/pascal/) (Pa). Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area.

Pressure may also be expressed in terms of standard atmospheric pressure. The [IUPAC](https://chemistdictionary.com/iupac/) recommendation for pressure is a lower-case _p_.

Manometric units such as the centimetre of water, millimetre or inch of mercury, are used to express pressures in terms of the height of a column of a particular fluid in a manometer.

An absolute pressure of zero corresponds to empty space or a complete vacuum.

### Types of pressure

### 1\. Fluid pressure

It is the compressive stress at some point within a fluid. Fluid pressure occurs in one of two situations:

- An open condition called open channel flow, e.g. the ocean, or the atmosphere.
- A closed condition called closed conduit, e.g. a water line or gas line.

### 2\. Deflagration pressure

Explosion or deflagration pressures are the results of the ignition of explosive gases, mists, dust/air suspensions, in unconfined and confined spaces.

### 3\. Negative pressure

Negative absolute pressures are effectively tension, and both bulk solids and bulk liquids can be put under negative absolute pressure by pulling on them.

### 4\. Stagnation pressure

The pressure when a fluid exerts when it is forced to stop moving. Consequently, although a fluid moving at higher speed will have a lower static pressure, it may have a higher stagnation pressure.

### 5\. Surface pressure

This is a two-dimensional analog of pressure, where the lateral force per unit length applied on a line perpendicular to the force.

### 6\. Vapour pressure

Vapour pressure is the pressure of a vapour in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases in a closed system. 

### 7\. Liquid pressure

Liquid pressure depends on the [density](https://chemistdictionary.com/density/) of the [liquid](https://chemistdictionary.com/liquid/). The pressure felt is due to the weight of the water above the object.
