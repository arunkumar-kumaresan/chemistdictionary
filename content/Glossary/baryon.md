A baryon is a type of composite subatomic particle which contains an odd number of valence [quarks](https://chemistdictionary.com/quark/) with half-integer spin.

Baryons belong to the [hadron](https://chemistdictionary.com/hadron/) family of particles, which are the quark-based particles. They are also classified as fermions.

Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle (antibaryon) where their corresponding antiquarks replace quarks.

Baryons participate in the strong interaction, which is mediated by particles known as gluons. The most familiar baryons are [protons](https://chemistdictionary.com/proton/) and [neutrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/neutron/).

### Nomenclature

The name "baryon", introduced by Abraham Pais, comes from the Greek word for "heavy" (barýs), because, at the time of their naming, most known elementary particles had lower mass than the baryons.

### Classification

Baryons are classified into groups according to their isospin values and quark (_q_) content.

### Nucleon (N)

A nucleon is either a proton or a neutron, considered in its role as a component of an atomic nucleus, consisting of three quarks.

### Delta (∆)

Delta Baryons are a family of the subatomic particle made of three up or down quarks (u or d quarks).

### Lambda (**λ**)

The Lambda baryons are a family of subatomic hadron particles containing one up quark, one down quark, and the third quark from a higher flavour generation.

### Sigma (Σ)

Sigma Baryons consists of subatomic hadron particles which have two quarks from the first flavour generation (up and/or down quarks), and the third quark from higher flavour generations.

### Xi (**Ξ**)

contain one up or down quark plus two more massive quarks either strange, charm or bottom. They are historically called the cascade particles.

### Omega (Ω)

They are the baryons that contain no up or down quarks. Omega baryons containing top quarks are not expected to be observed.
