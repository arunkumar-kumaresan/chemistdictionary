The reaction rate is the speed at which a [chemical reaction](https://chemistdictionary.com/chemical-reaction/) takes place. We define the reaction rate as the speed at which reactants are converted into products.

Reaction rates can vary dramatically. For most reactions, the rate decreases as the reaction proceeds.

The rate of a reaction is always positive. A negative sign is present to indicate that the reactant concentration is decreasing. 

The stoichiometric numbers are included so that the defined rate is independent of which reactant or product species is chosen for measurement.

When a [catalyst](https://chemistdictionary.com/catalyst/) is used the reaction rate may be stated on a catalyst weight or surface area basis. If the basis is a specific catalyst site that may be rigorously counted by a specified method.

Factors that influence the reaction rate are:

- The nature of the reaction
- [Concentration](https://chemistdictionary.com/concentration/)
- [Pressure](https://chemistdictionary.com/pressure/)
- Reaction order
- Temperature
- Solvent
- [Catalyst](https://chemistdictionary.com/catalyst/)
- Surface area

The [rate equation](https://chemistdictionary.com/rate-equation/) or rate law is a mathematical expression used in chemical kinetics to link the rate of a reaction to the concentration of each reactant.
