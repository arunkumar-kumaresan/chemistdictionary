An endothermic process is any process which requires or absorbs energy from its surroundings.

The energy absorbed usually is in the form of [heat](https://chemistdictionary.com/heat/).

A reaction to break a bond always requires the input of energy and so such a process is always endothermic. 

Endothermic analysis only accounts for the enthalpy change of a reaction. 

The change in entropic energy can overcome an opposite change in energy of an enthalpy process, make an endothermic reaction favourable.

### History

The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot.

The Greek roots _endo-_, derived from the word "endon" meaning within, and "therm" meaning hot or warm.
