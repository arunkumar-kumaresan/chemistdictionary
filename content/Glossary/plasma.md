Plasma consists of a gas of ions or atoms which have some of their orbital electrons removed, probably free electrons.

Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter and can be artificially generated by heating a neutral gas or subjecting it to a strong electromagnetic field to the point.

Based on the temperature and [density](https://chemistdictionary.com/density/) of the environment that contains a plasma, partially ionised or fully ionised forms of plasma may be produced.

Plasma is mostly associated with stars, extending to the rarefied intracluster medium and possibly the intergalactic regions.

Plasma is an electrically conducting medium in which there are roughly equal numbers of positively and negatively charged particles.

### History

The word _plasma_ comes from Ancient Greek which means 'moldable substance' or 'jelly' and describes the behaviour of the ionized atomic nuclei and electrons.

The term "plasma" was introduced as a description of ionised gas by Irving Langmuir in 1928.

### Common forms of plasma

### 1\. Terrestrial plasma

These sort of plasma are found in the magnetosphere that contains plasma in the Earth's surrounding space environment.

Upper-atmospheric lightning (e.g. Blue jets, Blue starters, Gigantic jets) comprises more plasma in the reaction.

### 2\. Artificially produced plasma

Those found in plasma displays, including TV screens, inside fluorescent lamps (low energy lighting), neon signs and Rocket exhaust and ion thrusters.

Inductively coupled plasmas (ICP), formed typically in argon gas for optical emission spectroscopy or mass spectrometry.

### 3\. Space and astrophysical plasma

This sort of plasma is found in the interplanetary medium(space between planets), the stars, the sunlight and even in interstellar nebulae.
