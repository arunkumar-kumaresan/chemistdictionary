Chemical formula any of several kinds of expressions of the composition or structure of chemical [compounds](https://chemistdictionary.com/compound/). It is not a chemical name, and it contains no words.

### Various forms of chemical formula

The simplest and very commonly used chemicals formulae are:

- Empirical formula
- Molecular formula
- Structural formula
- Projection formula

**Empirical formula** - This represents the composition of any member of an entire class of compounds. For example, the empirical formula of glucose is **CH₂O**.

**Molecular formula** - This indicates the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule, with no information on the structure. For example, the molecular formula of glucose is given as **C₆H₁₂O₆**.

**Structural formula** - Identifies the location of chemical bonds between the atoms of a molecule. A structural formula consists of symbols for the atoms connected by short lines that represent chemical bonds—one, two, or three lines standing for single, double, or triple bonds, respectively.

For example, the structural formula of ethane is,

Ethane

**Projection formula** - It is a two-dimensional representation of what is actually a three-dimensional molecule.

For example, the methane molecule in projection formula is given as,
