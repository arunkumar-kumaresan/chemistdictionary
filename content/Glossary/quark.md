A quark is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter, that combine to form composite particles called [hadrons](https://chemistdictionary.com/hadron/).

Due to colour confinement phenomenon, quarks are never found in isolation, they can be found only within hadrons, which include baryons.

Quarks are the only elementary particles in the Standard Model of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions known as fundamental forces.

### History

The quark model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964.

At the time of the quark theory's inception, the "particle zoo" included, among other particles, a multitude of hadrons. 

Their model involved three flavors of quarks, up, down, and strange, to which they ascribed properties such as spin and electric charge.

### Classification

The Standard Model is the theoretical framework describing all the currently known elementary particles. This model contains six flavours of quarks.

- The up quark or u quark is the lightest of all quarks, a type of elementary particle, and a major constituent of matter**.**
- The down quark or d quark is the second-lightest of all quarks.
- The strange quark or s quark is the third lightest of all quarks. Strange quarks are found in hadrons. 
- The charm quark, charmed quark or c quark is the third most massive of all quarks. Charm quarks are also found in hadrons.
- The bottom quark or b quark, also known as the beauty quark, is a third-generation quark with a charge of −1/3 e.
- The top quark, sometimes also referred to as the truth quark, is the most massive of all observed elementary particles. It derives its mass from its coupling to the Higgs Boson.
