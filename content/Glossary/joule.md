Joule is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the energy transferred to an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of the force.

It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule and it is represented by the letter J.

It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second.

A watt-second written in the symbol as  **W s** or **W.s** is a derived unit of energy equivalent to the joule. The watt-second is the energy equivalent to the power of one watt sustained for one second. 

In photography, the unit for flashes is the watt-second. A flash can be rated in watt-seconds or in joules, but historically, the term watt-second has been used.

The definition of the joule as J=kg⋅m2⋅s−2 has remained unchanged, but the joule as a derived unit has inherited changes in the definitions of the second, the metre and the kilogram.
