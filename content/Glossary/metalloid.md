A metalloid is a type of chemical element which has properties in between, or mixtures of [metals](https://chemistdictionary.com/metal/) and [nonmetals](https://chemistdictionary.com/non-metals/).

The recognised metalloids can be obtained by chemical reduction of either their oxides or their sulfides. Simpler or more complex extraction methods may be employed depending on the starting form.

Production methods for the elements less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or chemical reduction, or irradiation. 

There is no single property which can be used to unambiguously identify an element as a metalloid since most metalloids tend to display semiconducting properties.

The six commonly recognised metalloids are:

- [Boron](https://chemistdictionary.com/boron/)
- Silicon
- Germanium
- Arsenic
- Antimony
- Tellurium

Five elements are less frequently so classified include [carbon](https://chemistdictionary.com/carbon/), [aluminium](https://chemistdictionary.com/aluminium/), selenium, polonium, and astatine. 

Typical metalloids have a metallic appearance, but they are brittle and only fair conductors of electricity. Chemically, they behave mostly as nonmetals. 

The ionisation energy and electro-negativity value of metalloids are relatively high when compared to metals and non-metals.

### Etymology

The word metalloid comes from the Latin metallum ("metal") and the Greek _oeides_ ("resembling in form or appearance").

The term _metalloid_ originally referred to nonmetals. Its more recent meaning, as a category of elements with intermediate or hybrid properties, became widespread in 1940–1960.
