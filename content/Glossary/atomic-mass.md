Atomic mass is the mass of an [atom](https://chemistdictionary.com/atom-2/).

The number of neutrons in a nucleus affects the mass of the atom but not its chemical properties.

Neutrons and protons constitute the mass of an atom whereas, the electrons count is negligible.

The observed atomic mass is slightly less than the sum of the mass of protons, neutrons and electrons.

The difference, called the mass defect, is accounted for during the combination of these particles by conversion into binding energy.

### How to express atomic mass?

Atomic mass is often expressed in terms of non-SI unit called Dalton or atomic mass unit.

1 Dalton= 1/12 mass of single carbon-12 atom or 1.660538921 × 10−24 gram, when the atom is at rest.
