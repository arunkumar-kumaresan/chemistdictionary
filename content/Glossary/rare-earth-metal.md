Rare Earth metal is a set of seventeen chemical elements in the [periodic table](https://chemistdictionary.com/periodic-table/), with a majority of [lanthanides](https://chemistdictionary.com/lanthanide/).

Rare-earth elements, except scandium, are heavier than iron and thus are produced by supernova nucleosynthesis or by the s-process in asymptotic giant branch stars. 

The first rare-earth element discovered was the black mineral "ytterbite" which was renamed to gadolinite in 1800. It was discovered by Lieutenant Carl Axel Arrhenius in 1787.

The exact number of rare-earth elements that existed was highly unclear, and the use of X-ray spectra by Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley made it possible to assign [atomic numbers](https://chemistdictionary.com/atomic-number/) to the elements.

### Uses

In the USA, more than half of REEs are used for [catalysts](https://chemistdictionary.com/catalyst/), and ceramics, [glass](https://chemistdictionary.com/glass/) and polishing.

Used for the production of high-performance magnets, [alloys](https://chemistdictionary.com/alloy/).

Used in agriculture to increase plant growth, productivity, and stress resistance seemingly without negative effects.
