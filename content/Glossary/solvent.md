A solvent is a substance that dissolves a solute, resulting in a [solution](https://chemistdictionary.com/solution/), usually a liquid but can also be a solid, a gas, or a supercritical fluid.

The word solvent is derived from the Latin solvō, which means "loosen, untie, solve".

The quantity of solute that can dissolve in a specific volume of solvent varies with temperature.

The ability of one compound to be dissolved in another is known as solubility, if this occurs in all proportions, it is called miscible.

Most organic solvents are flammable or highly flammable, depending on their volatility. Mixtures of solvent vapours and air can explode.

### Solvent classification

Solvents can be broadly classified into two categories:

- Polar solvent: It is a solvent that has a hydrogen atom bound to oxygen similar to a hydroxyl group.
- Non-polar solvent: Solvents with a dielectric constant of less than 15 are generally considered to be non-polar.
