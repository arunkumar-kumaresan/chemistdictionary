Chelation is a type of bonding of ions and [molecules](https://chemistdictionary.com/molecule/) to metal ions.

 It involves the formation of two or more separate coordinate bonds between a polydentate (multiple bonded) ligands and a single central atom.

The chelate effect is the enhanced affinity of chelating ligands for a metal ion compared to the affinity of a collection of similar non-chelating (monodentate) ligands for the same metal.

Chelates are more stable than non-chelated compounds of comparable composition.

The more extensive the chelation the more stable the compound.

Organic compounds such as the amino acids glutamic acid and histidine, organic di-acids such as malate, and polypeptides such as phytochelatin are typical chelators.

### History

The word chelation is derived from Greek word _chēlē_, meaning claw, which represent the ligands lie around the central atom like the claws of a lobster. 

The term _chelate_ was first applied in 1920 by Sir Gilbert T. Morgan and H. D. K. Drew.
