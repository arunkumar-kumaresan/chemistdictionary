A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms, ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions as in [ionic bonds](https://chemistdictionary.com/ionic-bond/) or through the sharing of electrons as in [covalent bonds](https://chemistdictionary.com/covalent-bond/).

### Classification of chemical bond

The strength of chemical bonds is determined whether they are "strong bonds" or "weak bonds".

### Strong bond

Strong chemical bonds are the intramolecular forces that hold atoms together in molecules. 

A strong chemical bond is formed from the transfer or sharing of electrons between atomic centers and relies on the electrostatic attraction between the protons in nuclei and the electrons in the orbitals. 

The types of a strong bond differ due to the difference in electronegativity of the constituent elements:

**[Ionic bond](https://chemistdictionary.com/ionic-bond/)**

Has large electronegativity difference

**[Covalent bond](https://chemistdictionary.com/covalent-bond/)**

Two or more atoms share valence electrons more or less equally

**Metallic bond**

Bonding electrons are delocalized over a lattice of atoms

Types of Strong bonds

### Weak bond

Weak bonds are intermolecular forces that cause molecules to be attracted or repulsed by each other. These bonds define some of the physical characteristics of a substance(such as melting point).

**Dipole-Dipole interaction**

In this, two dipolar molecules interact with each other through space.

**Hydrogen bond**

Occurs between two molecules resulting from an electrostatic attraction between a proton in one molecule and an electronegative atom in the other. 

**London dispersion force**

Arises due to instantaneous dipoles in neighbouring atoms.

**Cation- Pi interaction**

Occurs between a pi-bond and a cation.

Types of Weak bonds
