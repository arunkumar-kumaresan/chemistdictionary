 Atomic weight is a dimensionless physical quantity.

It is defined as the ratio of the average mass of atoms of a chemical element in a given sample to the atomic mass constant.

The atomic mass constant is defined as 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

It is also referred to as Relative atomic mass.

 Relative atomic mass is also frequently used as a synonym for standard atomic weight.

These quantities may have overlapping values if the relative atomic mass used is that for an element from Earth under defined conditions.

The original standard of atomic weight, established in the 19th century, was [hydrogen](https://chemistdictionary.com/hydrogen/), with a value of 1.
