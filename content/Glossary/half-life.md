Half-life is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half of its initial value. The term is commonly used in nuclear physics.

Generally, the term is to characterize any type of exponential or non-exponential decay and to describe how long the stable atoms survive.

In other words, the half-life is defined in terms of probability as the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay on average. The probability of a radioactive atom decaying within its half-life is 50%.

Half-life is constant over the lifetime of an exponentially decaying quantity, and it is a characteristic unit for the exponential decay equation. 

### History

The original term, half-life period, dating to Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the principle in 1907, was shortened to half-life in the early 1950s.

Rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive element's half-life to studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead-206.
