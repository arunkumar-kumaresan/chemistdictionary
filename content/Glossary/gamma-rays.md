Gamma rays are penetrating electromagnetic radiation arising from the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei that consists of the shortest wavelength electromagnetic waves.

Natural sources of gamma rays originating on Earth are mostly as a result of [radioactive decay](https://chemistdictionary.com/radioactive-decay/) and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles.

Gamma rays are ionising radiation and are thus biologically hazardous. Due to their high penetration power, they can damage bone marrow and internal organs.

Due to their penetrating nature, gamma rays require large amounts of shielding mass to reduce them to levels which are not harmful.

When a gamma-ray passes through matter, the probability for absorption is proportional to the thickness, density and the absorption cross-section of the material. 

Compton scattering is an interaction in which an incident gamma photon loses enough energy to an atomic electron to cause its ejection.

The energy spectrum of gamma rays can be used to identify the decaying radionuclides using gamma spectroscopy.
