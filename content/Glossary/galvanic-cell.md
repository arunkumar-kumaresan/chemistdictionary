A galvanic cell is an electrochemical [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_cell) cell that derives electrical energy from spontaneous redox reactions taking place within the cell.

It is also termed as galvanic cell or voltaic cell, named after Luigi Galvani or Alessandro Volta.

It generally consists of two different metals immersed in [electrolytes](https://chemistdictionary.com/electrolyte/).

Otherwise, individual half-cells with different metals and their ions in solution are connected by a salt bridge or separated by a porous membrane.

The electromotive force of the cell is the difference between the half-cell potentials.

The emf depends on both the electrodes and on the electrolyte, an indication that the emf is chemical in nature.

### History

In 1780, Luigi Galvani discovered that when two different metals, are in contact, electricity was detected.

In 1799 Volta invented the voltaic pile, which is a pile of galvanic cells each consisting of a metal disk, an electrolyte layer, and a disk of a different metal.
