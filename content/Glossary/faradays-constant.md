Faraday constant is used in electrolysis calculations.

The Faraday constant in order to find the chemical amount (in [moles](https://chemistdictionary.com/mole/)) of the element that has been oxidized.

The Faraday constant, denoted by the symbol F.

This constant represents the magnitude of electric charge per mole of electrons.

The value of _F_ was first determined by weighing the amount of silver deposited in an electrochemical reaction using Faraday's law of electrolysis.

By the redefinition of SI units,

F = 96485.33212... C mol−1,

Where,

1mole = 6.022 140 76 x 1023 electrons (Avogadro number)

C -> Coulomb.
