Centrifugation is the technique which involves the application of centrifugal force to separate particles from a solution according to their size, shape, density, viscosity of the medium and rotor speed.

This technique is used to separate two miscible substances, and to analyze the hydrodynamic properties of macromolecules.

The rate of centrifugation is specified by the angular velocity usually expressed as revolutions per minute (RPM), or acceleration.

The conversion factor between RPM and the respective force of centrifuge depends on the radius of the centrifuge rotor. 

### History

In 1923, Theodor Svedberg and his student H. Rinde had successfully analyzed large-grained sols in terms of their gravitational sedimentation.

Sols consist of a substance evenly distributed in another substance, also known as a colloid.

 However, smaller grained sols, such as those containing gold, could not be analyzed.

To investigate this problem Svedberg developed an analytical centrifuge, equipped with a photographic absorption system, which would exert a much greater centrifugal effect.

### Applications

- Aids in the separation of proteins using purification techniques such as salting out.
- Separating chalk powder from water
- Removing fat from milk to produce skimmed milk
- Separating particles from an air-flow using cyclonic separation
- The clarification and stabilization of wine
