Vaporization is the conversion of a substance from the [liquid](https://chemistdictionary.com/liquid/) or [solid](https://chemistdictionary.com/solid/) phase into the gaseous ([vapour](https://chemistdictionary.com/vapour/)) phase. 

The term vaporization has also been used in a colloquial or hyperbolic way to refer to the physical destruction of an object that is exposed to intense heat or explosive force.

If conditions allow the formation of vapour bubbles within a liquid, the vaporization process is called boiling. Direct conversion from solid to vapour is called [sublimation](https://chemistdictionary.com/sublimation/).

The atoms or molecules of a liquid or solid are held together by cohesive forces, and these forces must be overcome in separating the atoms or molecules to form the vapour.

There are two types of processes involved in vaporization which are evaporation and boiling.

### Evaporation

Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which the phase transition from the liquid phase to vapour that occurs at temperatures below the boiling temperature at a given pressure. 

Evaporation only occurs when the partial pressure of vapour of a substance is less than the equilibrium vapour pressure. 

### Boiling

Boiling is a bulk phenomenon and a phase transition, from the liquid phase to the gas phase. In boiling, the formation of vapour bubbles of vapour is below the surface of the liquid.

Boiling occurs when the equilibrium vapour pressure of the substance is greater than or equal to the environmental pressure.
