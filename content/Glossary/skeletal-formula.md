The skeletal formula is a type of molecular structural formula that serves as a shorthand representation of a molecule's bonding and some details of its molecular geometry.

It is also called line-angle formula or shorthand formula that shows the skeletal structure or skeleton of a molecule, which is composed of the skeletal atoms that make up the molecule.

It employs certain conventions to represent [carbon](https://chemistdictionary.com/carbon/) and [hydrogen](https://chemistdictionary.com/hydrogen/) atoms, which are the most common in [organic chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/organic-chemistry/).

The skeletal structure of a[n](https://chemistdictionary.com/organic-compound/) [organic compound](https://chemistdictionary.com/organic-compound/) is the series of atoms bonded together that form the essential structure of the compound. 

The skeleton can consist of chains, branches and/or rings of bonded atoms. Skeletal atoms other than carbon or hydrogen are called heteroatoms.

Heteroatoms and other groups of atoms that give rise to relatively high rates of chemical reactivity, or introduce specific characteristics.

In the spectra of compounds, these heteroatoms are called functional groups, as they give the molecule a function, and they are collectively known as substituents.

An early form of this representation was first developed by the organic chemist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz, while the modern form is closely related to the Lewis (dot) structure of molecules.

In recent years, benzene is generally depicted as a hexagon with alternating single and double bonds, much like the structure originally proposed by Kekulé in 1872.
