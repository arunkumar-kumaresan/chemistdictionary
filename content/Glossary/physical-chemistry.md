Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of the principles, practices, and concepts of physics.

It deals with the concepts such as motion, [energy](https://chemistdictionary.com/energy/), force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, analytical dynamics and chemical equilibrium.

Some of the relationships that physical chemistry strives to resolve include the effects of:

- [Intermolecular forces](https://chemistdictionary.com/intermolecular-force/) that act upon the physical properties of materials.
- Reaction kinetics on the rate of a reaction and the reactions of electrochemical cells.
- Study of colligative properties of number of species present in solution.
- The identity of ions and the electrical conductivity of materials. Surface science and electrochemistry of cell membranes.
- Number of phases, number of components and degree of freedom can be correlated with one another with help of phase rule.

### History

The term "physical chemistry" was coined by Mikhail Lomonosov in 1752, when he presented a lecture course entitled "A Course in True Physical Chemistry".

Modern physical chemistry originated in the 1860s to 1880s with work on chemical thermodynamics, [electrolytes](https://chemistdictionary.com/electrolyte/) in solutions.
