The triple point of a substance is the [temperature](https://chemistdictionary.com/temperature/) and [pressure](https://chemistdictionary.com/pressure/) at which the three phases of that substance coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium.

The term "triple point" was coined in 1873 by James Thomson, brother of Lord Kelvin.

It is that temperature and pressure at which the sublimation curve, fusion curve and the vaporisation curve meet.

For solid, liquid, and gas phases, a triple point may involve more than one solid phase, for substances with multiple polymorphs. 

The triple point of water was used to define the kelvin, the base unit of thermodynamic temperature in the International System of Units (SI).

Triple-point cells are typically filled with a highly pure chemical substance such as hydrogen, argon, mercury, or water (depending on the desired temperature). 

The purity of these substances can be such that only one part in a million is a contaminant, called "six nines", hence used for calibration.

ITS-90, International calibration standard for [thermometers](https://chemistdictionary.com/thermometer/), relies upon triple-point cells of hydrogen, neon, oxygen, argon, mercury, and water for delineating six of its defined temperature points.
