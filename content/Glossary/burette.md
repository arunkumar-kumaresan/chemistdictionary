 The burette is a graduated glass tube with a tap at one end, for delivering known volumes of a liquid, especially in titrations. It is also called as Buret.

It is a long, graduated glass tube, with a stopcock at its lower end and a tapered capillary tube at the stopcock's outlet. 

The burette is volumetric measuring glassware which is used in [analytical chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/analytical-chemistry/) for the accurate dispensing of a liquid for titrations.

The burette is used to measure the volume of a dispensed substance but is different from a measuring cylinder as its graduations measure from top to bottom.

### History

The first burette was invented in 1845 by the French chemist Étienne Ossian Henry.

The word "burette" was coined in 1824 by the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac.

### Types of burette

There are two main types of burette; the volumetric burette and the Piston burette or Digital burette.

### 1\. Volumetric burette

A volumetric burette delivers measured volumes of liquid. 

It can be made of glass or plastic, and a straight tube with a graduation scale.

At the tip of the burette, there are a stopcock and valve to control the flow of the chemical solution.

The barrel of the stopcock can be made of glass or plastic PTFE. 

Burettes are manufactured for specific tolerances, designated as class A or B and this also is etched on the glass.

### 2\. Digital burette

Digital burettes are based on a syringe design. The barrel and plunger may be made of glass.

With liquids that corrode glass, including solutions of alkali, the barrel and plunger may be made of polyethylene or another resistant plastic material. 

The volume is shown on a digital display.  

Motorized digital burettes may be controlled by a computer.
