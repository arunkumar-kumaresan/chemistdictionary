A polymer is a substance or material consisting of very large molecules, or macromolecules, composed of many repeating subunits.

The units composing polymers are derived actually or conceptually from molecules of low relative molecular mass.

Polymers are studied in the fields of polymer science (which includes polymer chemistry and polymer physics), biophysics and material science and engineering.

Polymerization is the process of combining many small molecules known as monomers into a covalently bonded chain or network.

The structure of a polymeric material can be described at different length scales, from the sub-nm length scale up to the macroscopic one. 

The microstructure of a polymer or configuration relates to the physical arrangement of monomer residues along the backbone of the chain.

A branched polymer molecule is composed of the main chain with one or more substituent side chains or branches. Some of them include:

- Star polymers: Linear chains connected to a central core (at least three).
- Comb polymers: Main chain with multiple tri-functional branch points from each of which a linear side-chain emanates.
- Polymer brushes: A surface coating consisting of polymers tethered to a surface.
- Dendronized polymers: Regularly branched, tree-like fragments and for to give sausage-like, cylindrical molecular objects.
- Ladder polymers: Double-stranded polymer with the connectivity of a ladder. 
- Dendrimers: Repetitively branched molecules arborols and cascade molecules.

Polymer degradation is a change in the properties like tensile strength, colour, shape, or molecular weight of a polymer or polymer-based product under the influence of environmental factors.

This change in properties is often the result of bond breaking in the polymer backbone known as chain scission.

### Etymology

The term polymer derives from the Greek word polus, meaning many, much and meros, meaning part, which refers to large molecules whose structure is composed of multiple repeating units.

The chemical manipulation of polymers dates back to the 19th century, although at the time the nature of these species was not understood.
