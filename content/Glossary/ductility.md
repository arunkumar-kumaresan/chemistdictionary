Ductility is the capacity of a material to deform permanently in response to stress.

Ductility is especially important in metalworking.

This makes the materials to crack, break or shatter under stress, that cannot be manipulated using metal-forming processes.

High degrees of ductility occur due to metallic bonds, which are found predominantly in metals.

In metallic bonds, valence shell electrons are delocalized and shared between many atoms. 

Ductility can be quantified by the fracture strain, which is the engineering strain at which a test specimen fractures during a uniaxial tensile test. 

The most ductile metal is platinum.

The ductile–brittle transition temperature (DBTT), nil ductility temperature (NDT), or nil ductility transition temperature of a metal is the temperature at which the fracture energy passes below a predetermined value.

DBTT is a very important consideration in selecting materials that are subjected to mechanical stresses.
