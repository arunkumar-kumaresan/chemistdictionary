A semiconductor is a  material that has an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a conductor and an insulator.

The modern understanding of the properties of a semiconductor relies on quantum physics to explain the movement of charge carriers in a crystal lattice.

Doping greatly increases the number of charge carriers within the [crystal](https://chemistdictionary.com/crystal/). Doping, in general, is the addition of impurities to a pure semiconductor to increase its conductivity.

Heterojunctions occur when two differently doped semiconducting materials are joined together. This results in the exchange of charge carriers.

The process that creates and annihilates electrons and holes are called generation and recombination.

In semiconductors, at absolute zero temperature, the conduction band is empty and they behave like insulators.

Semiconductors have the small forbidden gap between the valence band (energy levels of valence electrons) and conduction band (energy levels of free electrons).

### Semiconductor types

Semiconductors are broadly classified into two categories.

### 1\. Intrinsic semiconductor

An intrinsic semiconductor is a pure semiconductor without any significant dopant species present. The number of holes and electrons is the same here.

In this, the Fermi level lies exactly at the centre of the forbidden gap.

### 2\. Extrinsic semiconductor

An extrinsic semiconductor is formed when an intrinsic semiconductor is doped with impurities.

When a doped semiconductor contains mostly free holes it is called p-type, and when it is mostly free electrons it is known as n-type.
