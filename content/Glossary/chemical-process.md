A chemical process is a method or means of somehow changing one or more chemicals or chemical compounds.

Chemists and other scientists use the term "chemical process" only in a general sense or in the engineering sense. 

Unit processing is the basic processing in chemical engineering.

### Few of the chemical processes in industries

### 1\. Oxidation & Reduction

Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state of an atom, an ion, or of certain atoms in a molecule.

Reduction is the gain of electrons or a _decrease_ in the oxidation state of an atom, an ion, or of certain atoms in a molecule.

### 2\. Hydrogenation & Dehydrogenation

Hydrogenation is a chemical reaction between molecular hydrogen (H2) and another compound or element, usually in the presence of a [catalyst](https://chemistdictionary.com/catalyst/).

Dehydrogenation is the vice-versa of hydrogenation.

### 4\. Hydrolysis

Hydrolysis is any chemical reaction in which a molecule of water ruptures one or more chemical bonds.

### 5\. Hydration

A hydration reaction is a chemical reaction in which a substance combines with water.

### 6\. Esterification

 Esterification is a chemical reaction in which two reactants (typically an alcohol and an acid) form an ester as the reaction product.

Esters are common in [organic chemistry](https://chemistdictionary.com/organic-chemistry/) and biological materials, and often have a pleasant characteristic, fruity odor.
